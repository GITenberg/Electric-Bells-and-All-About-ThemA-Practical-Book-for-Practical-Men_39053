<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>So rapidly has the use of electric bells and similiar
signalling appliances extended, in modern houses,
offices, hotels, lifts, and ships, that every bell-fitter
must have felt the need of accurate knowledge of the
manner in which these instruments act and are made.</p>

<p>In the following pages the author has attempted to
supply this need, by giving full details as to the construction
of batteries, bells, pushes, detectors, etc., the
mode of wiring, testing, connecting up, localizing faults,
and, in point of fact, by directing careful attention to
every case that can present itself to the electric-bell
fitter.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.</h3>


<p><a name="SEC_1" id="SEC_1"></a>§ 1. <span class="smcap">Electricity.</span>&mdash;The primary cause of all the
effects which we are about to consider resides in a force
known as <i>electricity</i>, from the Greek name of amber
(electron), this being the body in which the manifestations
were first observed. The ancients were acquainted
with a few detached facts, such as the attractive power
acquired by amber after friction; the benumbing shocks
given by the torpedo; the aurora borealis; the lightning
flash; and the sparks or streams of light which,
under certain conditions, are seen to issue from the
human body. Thales, a Grecian philosopher, who
flourished about 600 years <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, observed the former
of these facts, but nearly twenty centuries elapsed
before it was suspected that any connection existed
between these phenomena.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_2" id="SEC_2"></a>§ 2. According to the present state of our knowledge,<!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
it would appear that electricity is a mode of motion in
the constituent particles (or atoms) of bodies very
similar to, if not identical with, <i>heat</i> and <i>light</i>. These,
like <i>sound</i>, are known to be dependent on undulatory
motion; but, whilst <i>sound</i> is elicited by the vibration of
a body <i>as a whole</i>, electricity appears to depend, in its
manifestations, upon some motion (whether rotary,
oscillatory, or undulatory, it is not known) of the atoms
themselves.</p>

<p>However this be, it is certain that whatever tends to
set up molecular motion, tends also to call forth a display
of electricity. Hence we have several practical means
at our disposal for evoking electrical effects. These
may be conveniently divided into three classes, viz.:&mdash;1st,
mechanical; 2nd, chemical; 3rd, changes of temperature.
Among the <i>mechanical</i> may be ranged friction,
percussion, vibration, trituration, cleavage, etc. Among
the <i>chemical</i> we note the action of acids and alkalies
upon metals. Every chemical action is accompanied by
electrical effects; but not all such actions are convenient
sources of electricity. <i>Changes of temperature</i>,
whether sudden or gradual, call forth electricity, but the
displays are generally more striking in the former than
in the latter case, owing to the accumulated effect being
presented in a shorter time.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_3" id="SEC_3"></a>§ 3. We may now proceed to study a few of these
methods of evoking electricity, so as to familiarise ourselves
with the leading properties.</p>

<p>If we rub any resinous substance (such as amber,
copal, resin, sealing-wax, ebonite, etc.) with a piece of<!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
warm, dry flannel, we shall find that it acquires the
power of attracting light bodies, such as small pieces of
paper, straw, pith, etc. After remaining in contact
with the rubbed (or electrified) substance for a short
time, the paper, etc., will fly off as if repelled; and this
apparent repulsion will be more evident and more
quickly produced if the experiment be performed over a
metal tray. If a small pith-ball, the size of a pea, be
suspended from the ceiling by a piece of fine cotton,
previously damped and then approached by an ebonite
comb which has been briskly rubbed, it will be vigorously
attracted, and never repelled; but if for the
cotton there be substituted a thread or fibre of very fine
dry silk, the pith-ball will be first <i>attracted</i> and then
<i>repelled</i>. This is owing to the fact that the damp
cotton allows the electricity to escape along it: <i>id est</i>,
damp cotton is a <span class="smcap">CONDUCTOR</span> of electricity, while silk
does not permit its dissipation; or, in other words, silk
is a <span class="smcap">NON-CONDUCTOR</span>. All bodies with which we are
acquainted are found, on trial, to fall under one or other
of the two heads&mdash;viz., conductors and non-conductors.
Nature knows no hard lines, so that we find that even the
worst conductors will permit the escape of some electricity,
while the very best conductors oppose a measurable
resistance to its passage. Between the limits of good
conductors, on the one hand, and non-conductors (or
insulators) on the other, we have bodies possessing varying
degrees of conductivity.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_4" id="SEC_4"></a>§ 4. As a knowledge of which bodies are, and which
are not, conductors of electricity is absolutely essential<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to every one aspiring to apply electricity to any practical
purpose, the following table is subjoined, giving the
names of the commoner bodies, beginning with those
which most readily transmit electricity, or are <i>good</i> conductors,
and ending with those which oppose the highest
resistance to its passage, or are insulators, or non-conductors:&mdash;</p>

<p>The figures given as indicating the relative resistance
of the above bodies to the passage of electricity must
be taken as approximate only, since the conductivity of
all these bodies varies very largely with their purity, and
with the temperature. Metals become worse conductors
when heated; liquids and non-metals, on the contrary,
become better conductors.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that <i>dry air</i> is one of the<!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<i>best insulators</i>, or worst <i>conductors</i>, with which we are
acquainted; while damp air, on the contrary, owing to
the facility with which it deposits <i>water</i> on the surface
of bodies, is highly conducive to the escape of electricity.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_6" id="SEC_6"></a>§ 6. If the experiment described at <a href="#SEC_3">§ 3</a> be repeated,
substituting a glass rod for the ebonite comb, it will be
found that the pith-ball will be first attracted and then
repelled, as in the case with the ebonite; and if of
two similar pith-balls, each suspended by a fibre of silk,
one be treated with the excited ebonite and the other
with the glass rod, until repulsion occurs, and then
approached to each other, the two balls will be found to
attract each other. This proves that the electrical condition
of the excited ebonite and of the excited glass
must be different; for had it been the same, the two
balls would have repelled one another. Farther, it will
be found that the <i>rubber</i> with which the ebonite or the
glass rod have been excited has also acquired electrical
properties, attracting the pith-ball, previously repelled by
the rod. From this we may gather that when one body
acting on another, either mechanically or chemically,
sets up an electrical condition in one of the two bodies,
a similar electrical condition, but in the opposite sense,
is produced in the other: in point of fact, that it is
impossible to excite any one body without exciting
a corresponding but opposite state in the other. (We
may take, as a rough mechanical illustration of this, the
effect which is produced on the pile of two pieces of
plush or fur, on being drawn across one another in
opposite directions. On examination we shall find that<!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
both the piles have been laid down, the upper in the one
direction, the lower in the other.) For a long time
these two electrical states were held to depend upon two
distinct electricities, which were called respectively
<i>vitreous</i> and <i>resinous</i>, to indicate the nature of the bodies
from which they were derived. Later on (when it was
found that the theory of a single electricity could be
made to account for all the phenomena, provided it was
granted that some electrified bodies acquired more,
while others acquired less than their natural share of
electricity), the two states were known as <i>positive</i> and
<i>negative</i>; and these names are still retained, although it
is pretty generally conceded that electricity is not an
entity in itself, but simply a mode of motion.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_7" id="SEC_7"></a>§ 7. It is usual, in treatises on electricity, to give a
long list of the substances which acquire a positive or a
negative condition when rubbed against one another.
Such a table is of very little use, since the slightest
modification in physical condition will influence very
considerably the result. For example: if two similar
sheets of glass be rubbed over one another, no change
in electrical condition is produced; but if one be roughed
while the other is left polished, this latter becomes
positively, while the former becomes negatively, electrified.
So, also, if one sheet of glass be warmed, while the
other be left cold, the colder becomes positively, and
the latter negatively, excited. As a general law, <i>that
body, the particles of which are more easily displaced,
becomes negatively electrified</i>.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_8" id="SEC_8"></a>§ 8. As, however, the electricity set up by friction<!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
has not hitherto found any practical application in
electric bell-ringing or signalling, we need not to go
more deeply into this portion of the subject, but pass
at once to the electricity elicited by the action of acids,
or their salts, on metals.</p>

<p>Here, as might be expected from the law enunciated
above, the metal more acted on by the acid becomes
negatively electrified, while the one less acted on
becomes positive.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The following table, copied from
Ganot, gives an idea of the electrical condition which the

clear. Two strips, one of copper and the other of zinc,
1" wide by 4" long, have a 12" length of copper wire
soldered to one extremity of each. A small flat piece
of cork, about 1" long by 1" square section, is placed
between the two plates, at the end where the wires have
been soldered, this portion being then lashed together by
a few turns of waxed string. (The plates should not
touch each other at any point.) If this combination
(which constitutes a very primitive galvanic couple) be<!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
immersed in a tumbler three-parts filled with water,
rendered just sour by the addition of a few drops of
sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, we shall get a manifestation
of electrical effects. If a delicately poised
magnetic needle be allowed to take up its natural
position of north and south, and then the wires proceeding
from the two metal strips twisted in contact, so
as to be parallel to and over the needle, as shown in
<a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, the needle will be impelled out of its normal
position, and be deflected more or less out of the line of<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the wire. If the needle be again allowed to come to
rest <span class="smcap">N.</span> and <span class="smcap">S.</span> (the battery or couple having been
removed), and then the tumbler be held close over the
needle, as in <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>, so that the needle points from
the copper to the zinc strip, the needle will be again
impelled or deflected out of its natural position, but in
this case in the opposite direction.</p>

as is usually said, the electric current) is passing, be
brought over and parallel to a suspended magnetic
needle, pointing north and south, the needle is
immediately deflected from this north and south
position, and assumes a new direction, more or less
east and west, according to the amplitude of the
current and the nearness of the conductor to the
needle. Moreover, the direction in which the north
pole of the needle is impelled is found to be dependent
upon the direction in which the electric waves (or
current) enter the conducting body or wire. The law
which regulates the direction of these deflections, and
which is known, from the name of its originator, as
Ampère's law, is briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p><a name="SEC_11" id="SEC_11"></a>§ 11. "If a current be caused to flow <i>over</i> and parallel
to a freely suspended magnetic needle, previously
pointing north and south, the north pole will be
impelled to the <span class="smcap">LEFT</span> of the <i>entering</i> current. If, on
the contrary, the wire, or conductor, be placed
<i>below</i> the needle, the deflection will, under similar
circumstances, be in the opposite direction, viz.: the<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
north pole will be impelled to the <span class="smcap">RIGHT</span> of the
<i>entering</i> current." In both these cases the observer is
supposed to be looking along the needle, with its <span class="smcap">N.</span>
seeking pole pointing at him.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_12" id="SEC_12"></a>§ 12. From a consideration of the above law, in
connection with the experiments performed at <a href="#SEC_9">§ 9</a>,
it will be evident that inside the tumbler the zinc is
<i>positive</i> to the copper strip; while, viewed from the
outside conductor, the copper is positive to the zinc
strip.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<p><a name="SEC_13" id="SEC_13"></a>§ 13. A property of current electricity, which is the
fundamental basis of electric bell-ringing, is that of
conferring upon iron and steel the power of attracting
iron and similar bodies, or, as it is usually said, of
rendering iron magnetic. If a soft iron rod, say about
4" long by &frac12;" diameter, be wound evenly from end to
end with three or four layers of cotton-covered copper
wire, say No. 20 gauge, and placed in proximity to a
few iron nails, etc., no attractive power will be evinced;
but let the two free ends of the wire be placed in metallic
contact with the wires leading from the simple battery
described at <a href="#SEC_9">§ 9</a>, and it will be found that the iron has
become powerfully magnetic, capable of sustaining
several ounces weight of iron and steel, so long as the
wires from the battery are in contact with the wire
encircling the iron; or, in other words, "<i>the soft iron is a
magnet, so long as an electric current flows round it</i>."
If contact between the battery wires and the coiled wires<!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
be broken, the iron loses all magnetic power, and
the nails, etc., drop off immediately. A piece of soft
iron thus coiled with covered or "insulated" wire, no
matter what its shape may be, is termed an "electro-magnet."
Their chief peculiarities, as compared with
the ordinary permanent steel magnets or lodestones, are,
first, their great attractive and sustaining power; secondly,
the rapidity, nay, instantaneity, with which they lose all
attractive force on the cessation of the electric flow
around them. It is on these two properties that their
usefulness in bell-ringing depends.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_14" id="SEC_14"></a>§ 14. If, instead of using a <i>soft</i> iron bar in the above
experiment, we had substituted one of <i>hard</i> iron, or
steel, we should have found two remarkable differences
in the results. In the first place, the bar would have
been found to retain its magnetism instead of losing it
immediately on contact with the battery being broken;
and, in the second place, the attractive power elicited
would have been much less than in the case of soft iron.
It is therefore of the highest importance, in all cases
where rapid and powerful magnetisation is desired, that
the <i>cores</i> of the electro-magnets should be of the very
softest iron. Long annealing and gradual cooling
conduce greatly to the softness of iron.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_15" id="SEC_15"></a>§ 15. There is yet another source of electricity which
must be noticed here, as it has already found application
in some forms of electric bells and signalling, and which
promises to enter into more extended use. If we
sprinkle some iron filings over a bar magnet, or a horse-shoe
magnet, we shall find that the filings arrange<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
themselves in a definite position along the lines of
greatest attractive force; or, as scientists usually say, the
iron filings arrange themselves in the direction of the
lines of force. The entire space acted on by the
magnet is usually known as its "field." <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a> gives
an idea of the distribution of the iron filings, and also
of the general direction of the lines of force. It is found
that if a body be moved before the poles of a magnet
in such a direction as to cut the lines of force, electricity
is excited in that body, and also around the magnet.
The ordinary magneto-electric machines of the shops
are illustrations of the application of this property of
magnets. They consist essentially in a horse-shoe<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
magnet, in front of which is caused to rotate, by means
of appropriate gearing, or wheel and band, an iron
bobbin, or pair of bobbins, coiled with wire. The ends of
the wire on the bobbins are brought out and fastened
to insulated portions of the spindle, and revolve with it.
Two springs press against the spindle, and pick up the
current generated by the motion of the iron bobbins
before the poles of the magnet. It is quite indifferent
whether we use permanent steel magnets or electro-magnets
to produce this effect. If we use the latter,
and more especially if we cause a portion of the current
set up to circulate round the electro-magnet to maintain
its power, we designate the apparatus by the name of
<span class="smcap">Dynamo</span>.</p>

</div>


<p><a name="SEC_16" id="SEC_16"></a>§ 16. Our space will not permit of a very extended
description of the dynamo, but the following brief outline
of its constructive details will be found useful to
the student. A mass of soft iron (shape immaterial)
is wound with many turns of insulated copper wire, in
such a manner that, were an electrical current sent along
the wire, the mass of iron would become strongly north
at one extremity, and south at the other. As prolongations
of the electro-magnet thus produced are
affixed two masses of iron facing one another, and so
fashioned or bored out as to allow a ring, or cylinder of
soft iron, to rotate between them. This cylinder, or ring
of iron, is also wound with insulated wire, two or more
ends of which are brought out in a line with the spindle
on which it rotates, and fastened down to as many
insulated sections of brass cylinder placed around the<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
circumference of the spindle. Two metallic springs,
connected to binding screws which form the "terminals"
of the machine, serve to collect the electrical wave set up
by the rotation of the coiled cylinder (or "armature")
before the poles of the electro-magnet. The annexed
cut (<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>) will assist the student in getting a clear
idea of the essential portions in a dynamo:&mdash;<span class="smcap">E</span> is the
mass of wrought iron wound with insulated wire, and
known as the <i>field-magnet</i>. <span class="smcap">N</span> and <span class="smcap">S</span> are cast-iron
prolongations of the same, and are usually bolted to the
field-magnet. When current is passing these become
powerfully magnetic. <span class="smcap">A</span> is the rotating iron ring, or
cylinder, known as the <i>armature</i>, which is also wound
with insulated wire, <span class="smcap">B</span>, the ends of which are brought
out and connected to the insulated brass segments<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
known as the <i>commutator</i>, <span class="smcap">C</span>. Upon this commutator
press the two springs <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">D'</span>, known as the <i>brushes</i>,
which serve to collect the electricity set up by the
rotation of the armature. These <i>brushes</i> are in electrical
connection with the two terminals of the machine <span class="smcap">F F'</span>,
whence the electric current is transmitted where required;
the latter being also connected with the wire encircling
the field-magnet, <span class="smcap">E</span>.</p>

<p>When the iron mass stands in the direction of the
earth's magnetic meridian, even if it have not previously
acquired a little magnetism from the hammering, etc., to
which it was subjected during fitting, it becomes weakly
magnetic. On causing the armature to rotate by
connecting up the pulley at the back of the shaft (not
shown in cut) with any source of power, a very small
current is set up in the wires of the armature, due to the
weak magnetism of the iron mass of the field-magnet.
As this current (or a portion of it) is caused to circulate
around this iron mass, through the coils of wire surrounding
the field-magnet, this latter becomes more powerfully
magnetic (<a href="#SEC_13">§ 13</a>), and, being more magnetically active, sets
up a more powerful electrical disturbance in the armature.</p>

<p>This increased electrical activity in the armature
increases the magnetism of this field-magnet as before,
and this again reacts on the armature; and these
cumulative effects rapidly increase, until a limit is
reached, dependent partly on the speed of rotation,
partly on the magnetic saturation of the iron of which
the dynamo is built up, and partly on the amount of
resistance in the circuit.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This refers, of course, to those portions of the metals which are out of

<h3>ON THE CHOICE OF BATTERIES FOR ELECTRIC BELL
WORK.</h3>


<p><a name="SEC_17" id="SEC_17"></a>§ 17. If we immerse a strip of ordinary commercial
sheet zinc in dilute acid (say sulphuric acid 1 part
by measure, water 16 parts by measure<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>), we shall find
that the zinc is immediately acted on by the acid,
being rapidly corroded and dissolved, while at the same
time a quantity of bubbles of gas are seen to collect
around, and finally to be evolved at the surface of the
fluid in contact with the plate. Accompanying this
chemical action, and varying in a degree proportionate
to the intensity of the action of the acid on the zinc,
we find a marked development of <i>heat</i> and <i>electricity</i>.
If, while the bubbling due to the extrication of gas be
still proceeding, we immerse in the same vessel a strip
of silver, or copper, or a rod of graphite, taking care
that contact <i>does not</i> take place between the two
elements, no perceptible change takes place in the<!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
condition of things; but if we cause the two strips
to touch, either by inclining the upper extremities so
as to bring them in contact out of the fluid like a
letter &#923;, or by connecting the upper extremities
together by means of a piece of wire (or other conductor
of electricity), or by causing their lower
extremities in the fluid to touch, we notice a very
peculiar change. The extrication of bubbles around
the zinc strip ceases entirely or almost entirely, while
the other strip (silver, copper, or graphite) becomes
immediately the seat of the evolution of the gaseous
bubbles. Had these experiments been performed with
chemically pure metallic zinc, instead of the ordinary
impure commercial metal, we should have found some
noteworthy differences in behaviour. In the first place,
the zinc would have been absolutely unattacked by the
acid before the immersion of the other strip; and,
secondly, all evolution of gas would entirely cease when
contact between the two strips was broken.</p>

<p>As the property which zinc possesses of causing the
extrication of gas (under the above circumstances) has
a considerable influence on the efficiency of a battery,
it is well to understand thoroughly what chemical
action takes place which gives rise to this evolution of gas.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_18" id="SEC_18"></a>§ 18. All acids may be conveniently regarded as
being built up of two essential portions, viz.: firstly, a
strongly electro-negative portion, which may either
be a single body, such as <i>chlorine</i>, <i>iodine</i>, <i>bromine</i>, etc.,
or a compound radical, such as <i>cyanogen</i>; secondly,
the strongly electro-positive body <i>hydrogen</i>.<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Representing, for brevity's sake, hydrogen by the
letter H., and chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc., respectively
by Cl., Br., and I., the constitution of the acids derived
from these bodies may be conveniently represented by:&mdash;</p>

oxygen, united to 2 atoms of hydrogen) or nitric acid
(consisting of 1 nitrogen atom, 6 oxygen atoms, and
1 hydrogen atom), may advantageously be retained
in memory by the aid of the abbreviations:&mdash;</p>

<p>When zinc <i>does</i> act on an acid, it displaces the hydrogen
contained in it, and takes its place; the acid
losing at the same time its characteristic sourness and
corrosiveness, becoming, as chemists say, <i>neutralized</i>.
<i>One</i> atom of zinc can replace <i>two</i> atoms of hydrogen,
so that one atom of zinc can replace the hydrogen in
two equivalents of such acids as contain only one atom
of hydrogen.</p>

<p>This power of displacement and replacement possessed
by zinc is not peculiar to this metal, but is<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
possessed also by many other bodies, and is of very
common occurrence in chemistry; and may be roughly
likened to the substitution of a new brick for an old
one in a building, or one girder for another in an arch.</p>

<p>It will be well, therefore, to remember that in all
batteries in which acids are used to excite electricity
by their behaviour along with zinc, the following
chemical action will also take place, according to which
acid is employed:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_19" id="SEC_19"></a>§ 19. We learn from the preceding statements that
no electricity can be manifested in a battery or cell
(as such a combination of zinc acid and metal is called)
without consumption of zinc. On the contrary, we may
safely say that the more rapidly the <i>useful</i> consumption
of zinc takes place, the greater will be the electrical
effects produced. But here it must be borne in mind<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that if the zinc is being consumed when we are <i>not</i>
using the cell or battery, that consumption is sheer
waste, quite as much as if we were compelled to burn
fuel in an engine whether the latter were doing work
or not. For this reason the use of commercial zinc, in
its ordinary condition, is not advisable in batteries in
which acids are employed, since the zinc is consumed
in such, whether the battery is called upon to do
electrical work (by placing its plates in connection
through some conducting circuit) or not. This serious
objection to the employment of commercial zinc could
be overcome by the employment of chemically purified
zinc, were it not that the price of this latter is so
elevated as practically to preclude its use for this
purpose. Fortunately, it is possible to confer, on the
ordinary crude zinc of commerce, the power of resisting
the attacks of the acid (so long as the plates are not
metallically connected; or, in other words, so long as
the "circuit is broken"), by causing it to absorb
superficially a certain amount of mercury (quicksilver).
The modes of doing this, which is technically known
as <i>amalgamating the zinc</i>, are various, and, as it is
an operation which every one who has the care of
batteries is frequently called upon to perform, the
following working details will be found useful:&mdash;</p>


<p><a name="SEC_20" id="SEC_20"></a>§ 20. To amalgamate zinc, it should first be washed
with a strong solution of common washing soda, to
remove grease, then rinsed in running water; the
zinc plates, or rods, should then be dipped into a vessel
containing acidulated water (<a href="#SEC_17">§ 17</a>), and as soon as<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
bubbles of hydrogen gas begin to be evolved,
transferred to a large flat dish containing water. While
here, a few drops of mercury are poured on each
plate, and caused to spread quickly over the surface
of the zinc by rubbing briskly with an old nail-brush
or tooth-brush. Some operators use a kind of
mop, made of pieces of rag tied on the end of a stick,
and there is no objection to this; others recommend the
use of the fingers for rubbing in the mercury. This
latter plan, especially if many plates have to be done, is
very objectionable: firstly, on the ground of health, since
the mercury is slowly but surely absorbed by the system,
giving rise to salivation, etc.; and, secondly, because any
jewellery, etc., worn by the wearer will be whitened and
rendered brittle. When the entire surface of the zinc
becomes resplendent like a looking-glass, the rubbing
may cease, and the zinc plate be reared up on edge, to
allow the superfluous mercury to drain off. This should
be collected for future operations. It is important that
the mercury used for this purpose should be pure.
Much commercial mercury contains lead and tin. These
metals can be removed by allowing the mercury to
stand for some time in a vessel containing dilute nitric
acid, occasional agitation being resorted to, in order to
bring the acid into general contact with the mercury.
All waste mercury, drainings, brushings from old plates,
etc., should be thus treated with nitric acid, and finally
kept covered with water. Sprague, in his admirable
work on electricity, says:&mdash;"Whenever the zinc shows
a grey granular surface (or rather before this), brush it<!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
well and re-amalgamate, remembering that a saving of
mercury is no economy, and a free use of it no waste;
for it may all be recovered with a little care. Keep a
convenient sized jar, or vessel, solely for washing zinc in,
and brush into this the dirty grey powder which forms,
and is an amalgam of mercury with zinc, lead, tin, etc.,
and forms roughnesses which reduce the protection of the
amalgamation. Rolled sheet zinc should always be used
in preference to cast. This latter is very hard to amalgamate,
and has less electro-motive power<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; but for rods
for use in porous jars, and particularly with saline
solutions, cast-zinc is very commonly used. In this
case great care should be taken to use good zinc
cuttings, removing any parts with solder on them, and
using a little nitre as a flux, which will remove a portion
of the foreign metals."</p>


<p><a name="SEC_21" id="SEC_21"></a>§ 21. Another and very convenient mode of amalgamating
zinc, specially useful where solid rods or masses
of zinc are to be used, consists in weighing up the
zinc and setting aside four parts of mercury (by weight)
for every hundred of the zinc thus weighed up. The
zinc should then be melted in a ladle, with a little tallow
or resin over the top as a flux. As soon as melted, the
mercury should be added in and the mixture stirred with
a stick. It should then be poured into moulds of the
desired shape. This is, perhaps, the best mode of
amalgamating cast zincs.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_22" id="SEC_22"></a>§ 22. Some operators recommend the use of mercurial
salts (such as mercury nitrate, etc.) as advan<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>tageous
for amalgamating; but, apart from the fact that
these salts are generally sold at a higher rate than the
mercury itself, the amalgamation resulting, unless a very
considerable time be allowed for the mercuric salts to
act, is neither so deep nor so satisfactory as in the case
of mercury alone. It may here be noted, that although
the effect of mercury in protecting the zinc is very
marked in those batteries in which acids are used as the
exciting fluids, yet this action is not so observable in the
cases in which solutions of <i>salts</i> are used as exciters;
and in a few, such as the Daniell cell and its congeners,
the use of amalgamated zinc is positively a disadvantage.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_23" id="SEC_23"></a>§ 23. If, having thus amalgamated the zinc plate of
the little battery described and figured at <a href="#SEC_9">§ 9</a>, we repeat
the experiment therein illustrated, namely, of joining
the wires proceeding from the two plates over a suspended
magnetic needle, and leave them so united, we
shall find that the magnetic needle, which was originally
very much deflected out of the line of the magnetic
meridian (north and south), will very quickly return
near to its old and normal position; and this will be
found to take place long before the zinc has been all
consumed, or the acid all neutralised. Of course, this
points to a rapid falling off in the transmission of the
electric disturbance along the united wires; for had <i>that</i>
continued of the same intensity, the deflection of the
needle would evidently have remained the same likewise.
What, then, can have caused this rapid loss of
power? On examining (without removing from the<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
fluid) the surface of the copper plate, we shall find that
it is literally covered with a coating of small bubbles of
hydrogen gas, and, if we agitate the liquid or the plates,
many of them will rise to the surface, while the
magnetic needle will at the same time give a larger
deflection. If we entirely remove the plates from the
acid fluid, and brush over the surface of the copper
plate with a feather or small pledget of cotton wool
fastened to a stick, we shall find, on again immersing
the plates in the acid, that the effect on the needle is
almost, if not quite, as great as at first; thus proving
that the sudden loss of electrical energy was greatly due
to the adhesion of the free hydrogen gas to the copper
plate. This peculiar phenomenon, which is generally
spoken of as the <i>polarisation of the negative plate</i>, acts in
a twofold manner towards checking the electrical energy
of the battery. In the first place, the layer of hydrogen
(being a bad conductor of electricity) presents a great
resistance to the transmission of electrical energy from
the zinc plate where it is set up to the copper (or
other) plate whence it is transmitted to the wires, or
<i>electrodes</i>. Again, the <i>copper</i> or other receiving plate, in
order that the electric energy should be duly received
and transmitted, should be more electro-negative than
the zinc plate; but the hydrogen gas which is evolved,
and which thus adheres to the negative plate, is actually
very highly electro-positive, and thus renders the copper
plate incapable of receiving or transmitting the electric
disturbance. This state of things may be roughly
likened to that of two exactly equal and level tanks, <span class="smcap">Z<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></span>
and <span class="smcap">C</span>, connected by a straight piece of tubing. If <span class="smcap">Z</span> be
full and <span class="smcap">C</span> have an outlet, it is very evident that <span class="smcap">Z</span> can
and will discharge itself into <span class="smcap">C</span> until exhausted; but if <span class="smcap">C</span>
be allowed to fill up to the same level as <span class="smcap">Z</span>, then no
farther flow can take place between the two.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, very evident that to ensure anything
like constancy in the working of a battery, at least until
all the zinc be consumed or all the acid exhausted, some
device for removing the liberated hydrogen must be put
into practice. The following are some of the means
that have been adopted by practical men:&mdash;</p>


<p><a name="SEC_24" id="SEC_24"></a>§ 24. <i>Roughening the surface of the negative plate</i>,
which renders the escape of the hydrogen gas easier.
This mode was adopted by Smee in the battery which
bears his name. It consists of a sheet of silver, placed
between two plates of zinc, standing in a cell containing
dilute sulphuric acid, as shown at <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;">
<a name="FIG_5" id="FIG_5"></a>
<img src="images/i_037.png" width="328" height="400" alt="" title="The Smee cell" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>The silver sheet, before being placed in position, is
<i>platinised</i>; that is to say, its surface is covered (by electro-deposition)
with a coating of platinum, in the form
of a fine black powder. This presents innumerable
points of escape for the hydrogen gas; and for this
reason this battery falls off much less rapidly than the
plain zinc and smooth copper form. A modification of
Smee's battery which, owing to the large negative surface
presented, is very advantageous, is Walker's graphite
cell. In this we have a plate of zinc between two plates
of gas-carbon ("scurf"), or graphite. The surface of
this body is naturally much rougher than metal sheets;
and this roughness of surface is further assisted by<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
coating the surface with platinum, as in the case of
the Smee. The chief objection to the use of graphite is
its porosity, which causes it to suck up the acid fluid in
which the plates stand, and this, of course, corrodes the
brass connections, or binding screws.</p>

<p>Other <i>mechanical</i> means of removing the hydrogen
have been suggested, such as brushing the surface of the
plate, keeping the liquid in a state of agitation by boiling
or siphoning; but the only really efficient practical
means with which we are at present acquainted are
<i>chemical</i> means. Thus, if we can have present at the
negative plate some substance which is greedy of
hydrogen, and which shall absorb it or combine with
it, we shall evidently have solved the problem. This
was first effected by Professor Daniell; and the battery<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
known by his name still retains its position as one of the
simplest and best of the "constant" forms of battery.
The term "constant," as applied to batteries, does not
mean that the battery is a constancy, and will run for
ever, but simply that so long as there is in the battery any
fuel (zinc, acid, etc.), the electrical output of that battery
will be constant. The Daniell cell consists essentially
in a rod or plate of zinc immersed in dilute sulphuric
acid, and separated from the copper or collecting plate
by a porous earthen pot or cell. Around the porous
cell, and in contact with the copper plate, is placed a
solution of sulphate of copper, which is maintained
saturate by keeping crystals of sulphate of copper (blue
stone, blue vitriol) in the solution. Sulphate of copper
is a compound built up of copper Cu, and of sulphur
oxide SO<sub>4</sub>. When the dilute sulphuric acid acts on the
zinc plate or rod (<a href="#SEC_18">§ 18</a>), sulphate of zinc is formed, which
dissolves in the water, and hydrogen is given off:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now this free hydrogen, by a series of molecular
interchanges, is carried along until it passes through the
porous cell, and finds itself in contact with the solution
of copper sulphate. Here, as the hydrogen has a greater
affinity for, or is more greedy of, the sulphur oxide, SO<sub>4</sub>,
than the copper is, it turns the latter out, takes its place,
setting the copper free, and forming, with the sulphur
oxide, sulphuric acid. The liberated copper goes, and
adheres to the copper plate, and, far from detracting from<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
its efficacy, as the liberated hydrogen would have done,
actually increases its efficiency, as it is deposited in a
roughened form, which presents a large surface for the
collection of the electricity. The interchange which
takes place when the free hydrogen meets the sulphate
of copper (outside the porous cells) is shown in the
following equation:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<p><a name="SEC_25" id="SEC_25"></a>§ 25. The original form given to this, the Daniell
cell, is shown at <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>, in which <span class="smcap">Z</span> is the zinc rod standing
in the porous pot <span class="smcap">P</span>, in which is placed the dilute
sulphuric acid. A containing vessel, <span class="smcap">V</span>, of glazed earthenware,
provided with a perforated shelf, <span class="smcap">S</span>, on which
are placed the crystals of sulphate of copper, serves<!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to hold the copper sheet, <span class="smcap">C</span>, and the solution of sulphate
of copper. <span class="smcap">T</span> and <span class="smcap">T'</span> are the terminals from which the
electricity is led where desired.</p>

<p>In another form, the copper sheet itself takes the form
and replaces the containing vessel <span class="smcap">V</span>; and since the
copper is not corroded, but actually increases in thickness
during action, this is a decided advantage. A
modification, in which the porous cell is replaced by
<i>sand</i> or by <i>sawdust</i>, is also constructed, and known as
"Minotto's" cell: this, owing to the greater thickness
of the porous layer, offers more resistance, and gives,
consequently, less current. By taking advantage of the
greater specific gravity (<i>weight, bulk for bulk</i>) of the
solution of sulphate of copper over that of water or
dilute sulphuric acid, it is possible to construct a battery
which shall act in a manner precisely similar to a
Daniell, without the employment of any porous partition
whatsoever. <a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a> illustrates the construction of
one of these, known as "Gravity Daniells."</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 7. Gravity Cell.</p>
</div>

<p>In this we have a plate, disc, or spiral of copper, <span class="smcap">C</span>,
connected by an insulated copper wire to the terminal <span class="smcap">T'</span>.
Over this is placed a layer of crystals of copper sulphate;
the jar is then filled nearly to the top with dilute sulphuric
acid, or with a strong solution of sulphate of zinc
(which is more lasting in its effects, but not so energetic
as the dilute sulphuric acid), and on the surface of this,
connected to the other terminal, <span class="smcap">T</span>, is allowed to rest
a thick disc of zinc, <span class="smcap">Z</span>. Speaking of these cells, Professor
Ayrton, in his invaluable "Practical Electricity,"
says:&mdash;"All gravity cells have the disadvantage that<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
they cannot be moved about; otherwise the liquids
mix, and the copper sulphate solution, coming into contact
with the zinc plate, deposits copper on it. This
impairs the action, by causing the zinc to act electrically,
like a copper one. Indeed, without any shaking, the
liquids mix by diffusion, even when a porous pot is
employed; hence a Daniell's cell is found to keep in
better order if it be always allowed to send a weak
current when not in use, since the current uses up the
copper sulphate solution, instead of allowing it to
diffuse." The use of a solution of zinc sulphate to act
on the zinc rod, or plate, is always to be preferred in the
Daniell cell, when long duration is of more consequence
than energetic action.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_26" id="SEC_26"></a>§ 26. There are many other bodies which can be used
in batteries to absorb the hydrogen set free. Of several
of these we need only take a passing notice, as the<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
batteries furnished by their use are unfit for electric bell
work. Of these we may mention nitric acid, which
readily parts with a portion of the oxygen (<a href="#SEC_18">§ 18</a>) and
reconverts the free hydrogen into water. This acid is
used as the "depolarizer"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in the "Grove" and in the
"Bunsen" cell. Another very energetic "depolariser"
is chromic acid, either in solution, in dilute sulphuric
acid, or in the form of potassic dichromate (bichromate
of potash: bichrome). As one form of chromic cell has
found favour with some bell-fitters, we shall study its
peculiarities farther on.</p>

<p>Another class of bodies which readily part with their
oxygen, and thus act as depolarisers, are the oxides of
lead and manganese. This latter oxide forms the basis
of one of the most useful cells for electric bell work,
namely: the one known as the "Leclanché." As the
battery has been, and will probably remain, long a
favourite, the next paragraph will be devoted to its
consideration.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_27" id="SEC_27"></a>§ 27. The Leclanché cell, in its original form, consists
in a rod or block of gas carbon (retort scurf: graphite)
standing in an upright porous pot. Around this, so as
to reach nearly to the top of the porous cell, is tightly
packed a mixture of little lumps of graphite and black
oxide of manganese (manganic dioxide: black wad),
the porous cell itself being placed in an outer containing
vessel, which usually takes the form of a square glass
bottle. A zinc rod stands in one corner of the bottle,<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and is prevented from coming into actual contact with
the porous cell by having an indiarubber ring slipped
over its upper and lower extremities. The glass containing
vessel is then filled to about two-thirds of its height
with a solution of ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac) in
water, of the strength of about 2 oz. of the salt to each
pint of water. This soon permeates the porous cell and
reaches the mixture inside. The general appearance
of the Leclanché cell is well shown at <a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to ensure a large surface of contact for the
terminal of the carbon rod or plate, it is customary to
cast a leaden cap on the top thereof; and, as the porosity<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of the graphite, or carbon, is very apt to allow the fluid in
the battery to creep up to and corrode the terminal, and
thus oppose resistance to the passage of electricity, the
upper end of the carbon, before the lead cap is cast on,
is soaked for some time in melted paraffin wax, at a temperature
of 110° Centigrade: that is somewhat hotter than
boiling water heat. This, if left on the outside, would
prevent the passage of electricity almost entirely; so
lateral holes are drilled into the carbon before the cap
is finally cast on. The action that takes place in the
Leclanché cell may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the zinc, Zn, is acted on by the ammonium
chloride, 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, the zinc seizes the chlorine and forms
with it zinc chloride, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, while the ammonium, 2NH<sub>4</sub>,
is liberated. But this ammonium, 2NH<sub>4</sub>, does not escape.
Being electro-positive, it is impelled towards the negative
plate, and in its passage thereto meets with another
molecule of ammonium chloride, from which it displaces
the ammonium, in this wise: 2NH<sub>4</sub> + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl = 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
+ 2NH<sub>4</sub>; in other words, this electro-positive ammonium
is able, by virtue of its electrical charge, to displace
the ammonium from the combined chloride. In so
doing, it sets the liberated ammonium in an electro-positive
condition, as it was itself, losing at the same
time its electrical charge. This interchange of molecules
goes on (as we saw in the case of the Daniell's cell, <a href="#SEC_24">§ 24</a>)
until the surface of the carbon is reached. Here, as
there is no more ammonium chloride to decompose, the
ammonium 2NH<sub>4</sub> immediately splits up into ammonia
<!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>2NH<sub>3</sub> and free hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>. The ammonia escapes,
and may be detected by its smell; while the hydrogen
H<sub>2</sub>, finding itself in contact with the oxide of manganese,
2MnO<sub>2</sub>, seizes one atom of its oxygen, O, becoming
thereby converted into water H<sub>2</sub>O; while the manganese
dioxide, 2MnO<sub>2</sub>, by losing one atom of oxygen, is
reduced to the form of a lower oxide of manganese,
known as manganese sesquioxide, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Expressed
in symbols, this action may be formulated as below:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the zinc compartment&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
Zn + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl  =  ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><br />
</p>

<p>In the peroxide of manganese compartment&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
H<sub>2</sub> + 2MnO<sub>2</sub>  =  Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.<br />
</p>

<p>Ammonia gas therefore slowly escapes while this
battery is in action, and this corrodes all the brass work
with which it comes into contact, producing a bluish green
verdigris. If there be not sufficient ammonium chloride
in solution, the water alone acts on the zinc: zinc oxide
is produced, which renders the solution milky. Should
this be the case, more sal ammoniac must be added. It
is found that for every 50 grains of zinc consumed in this
battery, about 82 grains of sal ammoniac and 124 grains
of manganese dioxide are needed to neutralize the
hydrogen set free. It is essential for the efficient working
of this battery that both the manganese dioxide and
the carbon should be free from powder, otherwise it will
cake together, prevent the passage of the liquid, and
present a much smaller surface to the electricity, than if
in a granular form. For this reason, that manganese
dioxide should be preferred which is known as the<!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
"needle" form, and both this and the carbon should be
sifted to remove dust.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_28" id="SEC_28"></a>§ 28. In the admirable series of papers on electric bell
fitting which was published in the <i>English Mechanic</i>,
Mr. F. C. Allsop, speaking of the Leclanché cell, says:&mdash;"A
severe and prolonged test, extending over many years,
has proved that for general electric bell work the
Leclanché has no equal; though, in large hotels, etc.,
where the work is likely to be very heavy, it may,
perhaps, be preferable to employ a form of the Fuller
bichromate battery. It is very important that the
battery employed should be a thoroughly reliable one
and set up in a proper manner, as a failure in the battery
causes a breakdown in the communication throughout
the whole building, whilst the failure of a push or wire
only affects that portion of the building in which the
push or wire is fixed. A common fault is that of
putting in (with a view to economy) only just enough
cells (when first set up) to do the necessary work. This
is false economy, as when the cells are but slightly
exhausted the battery power becomes insufficient;
whereas, if another cell or two had been added, the
battery would have run a much longer time without
renewal, owing to the fact that each cell could have
been reduced to a lower state of exhaustion, yet still the
battery would have furnished the necessary power; and
the writer has always found that the extra expense of
the surplus cells is fully repaid by the increased length
of time the battery runs without renewal."</p>


<p><a name="SEC_29" id="SEC_29"></a>§ 29. Another form of Leclanché, from which great<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
things were expected at its introduction, is the one
known as the "Agglomerate block," from the fact that,
instead of simply placing the carbon and manganese
together loosely in a porous cell, solid blocks are
formed by compressing these materials, under a
pressure of several tons, around a central carbon core,
to which the terminal is attached in the usual manner.
The following are some of the compositions used in the
manufacture of agglomerate blocks:&mdash;</p>

<p>The materials having been reduced to fine powder,
and the proportion of water stated having been added,
are intimately mixed together by hand or mechanically.
The moist mixture is moulded at the ordinary temperature,
either by a simple compressing press, or by a press
in which two pistons moving towards each other compress
the block on two opposite faces; or the mixture
may be compressed by drawing, as in the manufacture
of electric light carbon. After compression, the
products are sufficiently solid to be manipulated. They
are then put in a stove, or oven, the temperature
of which is gradually raised to about 350° C. (about
662° Fahr.); a temperature which is insufficient to
decompose the depolarising substance (manganese
dioxide), but sufficient to drive out first the volatile
parts of the agglomerating material, and then to transform
its fixed parts in a body unattackable by the
ammonia of the cell. During the gradual heating, or
baking, which lasts about two hours, what remains of
the water in the agglomerate is driven off; then come the
more volatile oils contained in the pitch, and finally the
sulphur. The sulphur is added to the mixture, not as an
agglomerative, but as a chemical re-agent (and this is a
characteristic feature in the invention), acting on what
remains of the pitch, as it acts on all carbo-hydrides at
a high temperature, transforming it partially into
volatile sulphuretted compounds, which are expelled by
the heat, and partially into a fixed and unattackable
body, somewhat similar to vulcanite. The action of
the sulphur on the pitch can very well be likened to its<!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
action on caoutchouc (which is likewise a hydro-carbon)
during the process of vulcanisation.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>These agglomerate blocks, however prepared, are
placed in glass or porcelain containing vessels, as shown
in <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>, with a rod of zinc, separated from actual
contact with the carbon by means of a couple of crossed
indiarubber bands, which serve at the same time to
hold the zinc rods upright. The exciting solution, as
in the case of the ordinary Leclanché consists in a
solution of ammonium chloride.</p>

<p>Among the various advantages claimed
for the agglomerate form of Leclanché over
the ordinary type, may be mentioned the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The depolarising power of the manganese
oxide is used to the best advantage,
and that, owing to this, the electro-motive
force of the battery is kept at the same
point.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;That, owing to the absence of the
porous cell, there is less internal resistance
in the battery and therefore more available current.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;That the resistance of the battery remains pretty
constant, whatever work be put upon it.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;That, owing to the fact that the liquid comes
into contact with both elements immediately, the battery
is ready for use directly on being charged.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;That the renewal or recharging is exceedingly
easy, since the elements can be removed together, fresh
solution added, or new depolarising blocks substituted.<!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>But when this battery came to be put to the test of
practical work, it was found the block form could not be
credited with all these advantages, and that their chief
superiority over the old cell consisted rather in their
lower internal resistance than in anything else. Even
this is not an advantage in the case of bell work, except
when several bells are arranged <i>in parallel</i>, so that a
large current is required. The blocks certainly polarise
more quickly than the old form, and it does not appear
that they depolarise any more rapidly. Probably the
enormous pressure to which the blocks are subjected, in
the first two processes, renders the composition almost
impermeable to the passage of the fluid, so that depolarisation
cannot take place very rapidly. Another and
serious objection to these blocks is that, after a little
work, pieces break away from the blocks and settle on
the zinc. This sets up a "short circuit," and the zincs
are consumed whether the battery is in action or not.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_30" id="SEC_30"></a>§ 30. A third form of Leclanché, and one which has
given considerable satisfaction, is the one known as
"Judson's Patent." This consists, as shown at <a href="#FIG_10">Fig.
10</a>, in a cylinder of corrugated carbon encased in an
outer coating of an insulating composition. Inside the
cell are two or more thin carbon sheets, cemented to the
sides of the cell by Prout's elastic glue, or some similar<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
compound, so as to leave spaces, which are filled in with
granular carbon and manganese. The surface of the
plates is perforated, so as to allow ready access to the
exciting fluid. The zinc rod, which is affixed to the
cover, stands in the centre of the cell, touching it at no
part. Owing to the very large surface presented by the
corrugations in the carbon, and by the perforated carbon
plates, the internal resistance of this form
of battery is very low; hence the current,
if employed against a small outer resistance,
is large. But this, except in the case of
bells arranged in parallel, is of no great
advantage.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_31" id="SEC_31"></a>§ 31. The ordinary form of Leclanché is
found in market in three sizes, viz., No. 1,
No. 2, and No. 3. Unfortunately, all makers
do not use these numbers in the same manner,
so that while some call the smallest, or
<i>pint</i> size, No. 1, others give this name to the
largest, or <i>three-pint</i>, size. No. 2 is always
quart size, and this is the one commonly
employed. When several cells are employed
to work a number of bells, it is well, in order
that they may not receive injury, that they be enclosed
in a wooden box. As it is necessary that the batteries
should be inspected from time to time, boxes are
specially made with doubled hinged top and side, so
that when the catch is released these fall flat; thus
admitting of easy inspection or removal of any individual
cell. This form of battery box is shown at <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>.<!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_32" id="SEC_32"></a>§ 32. There are certain ills to which the Leclanché
cells are liable that require notice here. The first is
<i>creeping</i>. By creeping is meant the gradual crystallisation
of the sal ammonium up the inside and round
the outside of the glass containing jar. There are
two modes of preventing this. The first consists in
filling in the neck with melted pitch, two small funnel-like
tubes being previously inserted to admit of the
addition of fresh sal ammoniac solution, and for the
escape of gas. This mode cannot be recommended, as
it is almost impossible to remove the pitch (in case it be
required to renew the zinc, etc.) without breaking the
glass vessel. The best way to remove the pitch is to<!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
place the cell in a large saucepan of cold water, and
set it on a fire until the water boils. The pitch is,
by this treatment, so far softened that the elements
can be removed and the pitch scraped away with a
knife.</p>

<a name="FIG_12" id="FIG_12"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 12.</p>
</div>

<p>By far the better mode is to
rub round the inside and outside
of the neck of the jar with
tallow, or melted paraffin wax,
to the depth of an inch or
thereabouts. This effectually
prevents creeping and the consequent
loss of current. Messrs.
Gent, of Leicester, have introduced
a very neat modification
of the Leclanché cell, with a
view to obviate altogether the
evils deriving from creeping.
This cell is illustrated at <a href="#FIG_12">Fig.
12</a>, and the following is the
description supplied by the
patentees:&mdash;"All who have had experience of batteries in
which a solution of salts is used are aware of the difficulty
experienced in preventing it creeping over the outside of
the jar, causing local loss, and oftentimes emptying the
jar of its solution. Many devices have been tried to
prevent this, but the only effectual one is our patent
insulated jar, in which a recess surrounds the top of the
jar, this recess being filled with a material to which the
salts will not adhere, thus keeping the outside of the<!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
jar perfectly clean. It is specially adapted for use in
hot climates, and is the only cell in which jars may
touch each other and yet retain their insulations. We
confidently recommend a trial of this cell. Its price is
but little in excess of the ordinary Leclanché." The
battery should be set up in as cool a place as possible,
as heat is very conducive to creeping. It is also
important that the battery should be placed as near
as convenient to the bell.</p>

<p>Sometimes the zincs are seen to become coated with
a black substance, or covered with crystals, rapidly
wasting away at the same time, although doing little or
no work; a strong smell of ammonia being given off at
the same time. When this occurs, it points to an
electrical leakage, or short circuit, and this, of course,
rapidly exhausts the battery. It is of the utmost importance
to the effective working of any battery that
not the slightest leakage or <i>local action</i> should be
allowed to take place. However slight such loss be, it
will eventually ruin the battery. This leakage may be
taking place in the battery, as a porous cell may be
broken, and carbon may be touching the zinc; or out of
the battery, along the conducting wires, by one touching
the other, or through partial conductivity of a damp
wall, a metallic staple, etc., or by creeping. If loss or
local action has taken place, it is best, after discovering
and repairing the faults (see also <i>testing wires</i>),
to replace the old zincs by new ones, which are not
costly.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_33" id="SEC_33"></a>§ 33. There is yet a modification of the Leclanché<!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
which is sometimes used to ring the large bells in hotels,
etc., known as the Leclanché reversed, since the zinc is
placed in the porous pot, this latter being stood in the
centre of the stoneware jar, the space between the two
being packed with broken carbon and manganese
dioxide. By this means a very much larger negative
surface is obtained. In the Grenet cell, the porous cell
is replaced by a canvas bag, which is packed full of
lumps of graphite and carbon dioxide, a central rod of
carbon being used as the electrode. This may be used in
out-of-the-way places where porous cells are not readily
obtainable, but I cannot recommend them for durability.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_34" id="SEC_34"></a>§ 34. The only other type of battery which it will be
needful to notice in connection with bell work is one
in which the depolariser is either chromic acid or a
compound of chromic acid with potash or lime. Chromic
acid consists of hydrogen united to the metal chromium
and oxygen. Potassic dichromate (bichromate of
potash: bichrome) contains potassium, chromium, and
oxygen. If we represent potassium by K, chromium by
Cr, and oxygen by O, we can get a fair idea of its constitution
by expressing it as K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, by which it is
shown that one molecule of this body contains two atoms
of potassium united to two atoms of chromium and seven
atoms of oxygen. Bichromate of potash readily parts
with its oxygen; and it is upon this, and upon the
relatively large amount of oxygen it contains, that its
efficiency as a depolariser depends. Unfortunately,
bichromate of potash is not very soluble in water; one
pint of water will not take up much more than three<!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ounces of this salt. Hence, though the solution of
potassium bichromate is an excellent depolariser as long
as it contains any of the salt, it soon becomes exhausted.
When bichromate of potash is used in a cell along with
sulphuric acid and water, sulphate of potash and
chromic acid are formed, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>From this we learn that before the potassium
bichromate enters into action in the battery, it is
resolved into chromic acid. Chromic acid is now
prepared cheaply on a large scale, so that potassium
bichromate may always be advantageously replaced by
chromic acid in these batteries; the more so as chromic
acid is extremely soluble in water. In the presence of
the hydrogen evolved during the action of the battery
(<a href="#SEC_18">§ 18</a>) chromic acid parts with a portion of its oxygen,
forming water and sesquioxide of chromium, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and
this, finding itself in contact with the sulphuric acid,
always used to increase the conductivity of the liquid,
forms sulphate of chromium. The action of the
hydrogen upon the chromic acid is shown in the
following equation:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_35" id="SEC_35"></a>§ 35. The "bottle" form of the bichromate or chromic
acid battery (as illustrated at <a href="#FIG_13">Fig. 13</a>) is much employed
where powerful currents of short duration are required.
It consists of a globular bottle with a rather long wide
neck, in which are placed two long narrow graphite
plates, electrically connected to each
other and to one of the binding screws
on the top. Between these two plates
is a sliding rod, carrying at its lower
extremity the plate of zinc. This sliding
rod can be lowered and raised, or retained
in any position, by means of
a set screw. The zinc is in metallic
connection with the other binding screw.
This battery (which, owing to the facility
with which the zinc can be removed
from the fluid, is extremely convenient and economical
for short experiments) may be charged with either of
the following fluids:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>This also must not be used till cold.</p>

<p>In either case the bottle must not be more than three
parts filled with the exciting fluid, to allow plenty of
room for the zinc to be drawn right out of the liquid
when not in use.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_36" id="SEC_36"></a>§ 36. The effects given by the above battery, though
very powerful, are too transient to be of any service
in continuous bell work. The following modification,
known as the "Fuller" cell, is, however, useful where
powerful currents are required, and, when carefully set
up, may be made to do good service for five or six
months at a stretch. The "Fuller" cell consists in an
outer glass or glazed earthern vessel, in which stands a
porous pot. In the porous pot is placed a large block
of amalgamated zinc, that is cast around a stout
copper rod, which carries the binding screw. This rod
must be carefully protected from the action of the fluid,
by being cased in an indiarubber tube. The amalgamation
of the zinc must be kept up by putting a small
quantity of mercury in the porous cell. The porous
cells must be paraffined to within about half an inch of
the bottom, to prevent too rapid diffusion of the liquids,<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and the cells themselves should be chosen rather thick
and close in texture, as otherwise the zinc will be rapidly
corroded. Water alone is used as the exciting fluid in
the porous cell along with the zinc. Speaking of this
form of cell, Mr. Perren-Maycock says:&mdash;"The base of
the zinc is more acted on (when bichromate crystals are
used), because the porous cells rest on the crystals;
therefore let it be well paraffined,
as also the top edge. Instead of
paraffining the pot in strips all
round (as many operators do)
paraffin the pot all round, except at
one strip about half an inch wide,
and let this face the carbon plate.
If this be done, the difference in
internal resistance between the cell
with paraffined pot and the same
cell with pot unparaffined will be
little; but if the portion that is
unparaffined be turned away from
the carbon, it will make very nearly
an additional 1 ohm resistance. It
is necessary to have an ounce or so
of mercury in each porous cell, covering the foot of the
zinc; or the zincs may be cast short, but of large diameter,
hollowed out at the top to hold mercury, and
suspended in the porous pot. The zinc is less acted on
then, for when the bichromate solution diffuses into the
porous pot, it obviously does so more at the bottom
than at the top."<!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_37" id="SEC_37"></a>§ 37. Before leaving the subject of batteries, there
are certain points in connection therewith that it is
absolutely essential that the practical man should
understand, in order to be able to execute any work
satisfactorily. In the first place, it must be borne in
mind that a cell or battery, when at work, is continually
setting up electric undulations, somewhat in the same
way that an organ pipe, when actuated by a pressure
of air, sets up a continuous sound wave. Whatever
sets up the electric disturbance, whether it be the action
of sulphuric acid on zinc, or caustic potash on iron, etc.,
is called <i>electromotive force</i>, generally abbreviated E.M.F.
Just in the same manner that the organ pipe could give
no sound if the pressure of air were alike inside and
out, so the cell, or battery, cannot possibly give <i>current</i>,
or evidence of electric flow, unless there is some means
provided to allow the <i>tension</i>, or increased atomic motion
set up by the electromotive force, to distribute itself
along some line of conductor or conductors not subjected
to the same pressure or E.M.F. In other words,
the "current" of electricity will always tend to flow
from that body which has the highest tension, towards
the body where the strain or tension is less. In a cell
in which zinc and carbon, zinc and copper, or zinc and
silver are the two elements, with an acid as an
excitant, the zinc during the action of the acid
becomes of higher "potential" than the other element,<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and consequently the undulations take place towards
the negative plate (be it carbon, copper, or silver).
But by this very action the negative plate immediately
reaches a point of equal tension, so that no current
is possible. If, however, we now connect the two
plates together by means of any conductor, say
a copper wire, then the strain to which the carbon
plate is subjected finds its exit along the wire and
the zinc plate, which is continually losing its strain
under the influence of the acid, being thus at a lower
potential (electrical level, strain) than the carbon, can
and does actually take in and pass on the electric
vibrations. It is therefore evident that no true "current"
can pass unless the two elements of a battery are
connected up by a conductor. When this connection
is made, the circuit is called a "<i>closed circuit</i>." If, on
the contrary, there is no electrical connection between
the negative and positive plates of a cell or battery,
the circuit is said to be open, or <i>broken</i>. It may be that
the circuit is closed by some means that is not desirable,
that is to say, along some line or at some time when and
where the flow is not wanted; as, for instance, the outside
of a cell may be <i>wet</i>, and one of the wires resting against
it, when of course "leakage" will take place as the
circuit will be closed, though no useful work will be done.
On the other hand, we may actually take advantage of
the practically unlimited amount of the earth's surface,
and of its cheapness as a conductor to make it act as a
portion of the conducting line. It is perfectly true that
the earth is a very poor conductor as compared with<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
metals. Let us say, for the sake of example, that damp
earth conducts 100,000 times worse than copper. It
will be evident that if a copper wire 1/20 of an inch in
section could convey a given electric current, the same
length of earth having a section of 5,000 inches would
carry the same current equally well, and cost virtually
nothing, beyond the cost of a metal plate, or sack of
coke, presenting a square surface of a little over 70 inches
in the side at each end of the line. This mode of completing
the circuit is known as "the earth plate."</p>


<p><a name="SEC_38" id="SEC_38"></a>§ 38. The next point to be remembered in connection
with batteries is, that the electromotive force
(E.M.F.) depends on the <i>nature</i> of the elements (zinc
and silver, zinc and carbon, etc.) and the excitants used
in the cell, and has absolutely nothing whatever to do
with their <i>size</i>. This may be likened to difference of
temperature in bodies. Thus, whether we have a block
of ice as large as an iceberg or an inch square, the temperature
will never exceed 32°F. as long as it remains
ice; and whether we cause a pint or a thousand gallons
of water to boil (under ordinary conditions), its temperature
will not exceed 212°F. The only means we
have of increasing the E.M.F., or "tension," or "potential,"
of any given battery, is by connecting up its
constituent cells in <i>series</i>; that is to say, connecting the
carbon or copper plate of the one cell to the zinc of the
next, and so on. By this means we increase the E.M.F.
just in the same degree as we add on cells. The accepted
standard for the measure of electromotive force is
called a VOLT, and 1 volt is practically a trifle less than<!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the E.M.F. set up by a single Daniell's cell; the exact
amount being 1·079 volt, or 1-1/12 volt very nearly. The
E.M.F. of the Leclanché is very nearly 1·6 volt, or
nearly 1 volt and 2/3. Thus in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>, which illustrates
3 Leclanché cells set up in series, we should get</p>

</div>


<p><a name="SEC_39" id="SEC_39"></a>§ 39. The <i>current</i>, or amplitude of the continuous
vibrations kept up in the circuit, depends upon two
things: 1st, the electromotive force; 2nd, the resistance
in the circuit. There is a certain amount of resemblance
between the flow of water under pressure and
electricity in this respect. Let us suppose we have a<!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
constant "head" of water at our disposal, and allow it
to flow through a tube presenting 1 inch aperture. We
get a certain definite flow of water, let us say 100
gallons of water per hour. More we do not get, owing
to the resistance opposed by the narrowness of the tube
to a greater flow. If now we double the capacity of the
exit tube, leaving the pressure or "head" of water the
same, we shall double the flow of water. Or we may
arrive at the same result by doubling the "head" or
pressure of water, which will then cause a double quantity
of water to flow out against the same resistance in
the tube, or conductor. Just in the same way, if we
have a given pressure of electric strain, or E.M.F., we
can get a greater or lesser flow or "current" by having
less or more resistance in the circuit. The standard of
flowing current is called an <span class="smcap">Ampère</span>; and 1 ampère is
that current which, in passing through a solution of
sulphate of copper, will deposit 18·35 grains of copper
per hour. The unit of resistance is known as an <span class="smcap">Ohm</span>.
The resistance known as 1 ohm is very nearly that of a
column of mercury 1 square millimètre (1/25 of an inch)
in section, and 41&frac14; inches in height; or 1 foot of No.
41 gauge pure copper wire, 33/10000 of an inch in diameter,

the relative effects of the resistance inserted in the circuit,
the electromotive force, and the current produced,
enunciated the following law, which, after him, has been
called "<span class="smcap">Ohm's Law</span>." It is that if we divide the number
of electromotive force units (volts) employed by<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the number of resistance units (ohms) in the entire circuit,
we get the number of current units (ampères) flowing
through the circuit. This, expressed as an equation
is shown below:</p>

<p class="center">E/R = C or Electromotive force/Resistance = Current.</p>

<p>Or if we like to use the initials of volts, ampères, and
ohms, instead of the general terms, E, R, and C, we
may write V/R = A, or Volts/Ohms = Ampères.</p>

<p>From this it appears that 1 volt will send a current
of 1 ampère through a total resistance of 1 ohm, since
1 divided by 1 equals 1. So also 1 volt can send a
current of 4 ampères through a resistance of &frac14; of an
ohm, since 1 divided by &frac14; is equal to 4. We can therefore
always double the current by halving the resistance;
or we may obtain the same result by doubling the
E.M.F., allowing the resistance to remain the same.
In performing this with batteries we must bear in mind
that the metals, carbon, and liquids in a battery do
themselves set up resistance. This resistance is known
as "<i>internal resistance</i>," and must always be reckoned
in these calculations. We can <i>halve</i> the internal resistance
by <i>doubling</i> the size of the negative plate, or what
amounts to the same thing by connecting two similar
cells "<i>in parallel</i>;" that is to say, with both their zincs
together, to form a positive plate of double size, and both
carbons or coppers together to form a single negative of
twice the dimensions of that in one cell. Any number<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of cells thus coupled together "<i>in parallel</i>" have their
resistances reduced just in proportion as their number
is increased; hence 8 cells, each having a resistance of
1 ohm if coupled together <i>in parallel</i> would have a
joint resistance of &#8539; ohm only. The E.M.F. would
remain the same, since this does not depend on the size
of the plate (see <a href="#SEC_38">§ 38</a>). The arrangement of cells in
parallel is shown at <a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>, where three Leclanché cells
are illustrated thus coupled. The following little table
gives an idea of the E.M.F. in volts, and the internal<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
resistance in ohms, of the cells mostly used in electric
bell work.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that if we joined up the two
plates of a Fuller cell with a short wire presenting no
appreciable resistance, we should get a current of (1·80
divided by 0·50) 3·6 ampères along the wire; whereas if a
gravity Daniell were employed the current flowing in
the same wire would only be a little over 1/10 of an
ampère, since 1·079/10 = 0·1079. But every wire, no matter
how short or how thick, presents <i>some</i> resistance; so we
must always take into account both the internal resistance
(that of the battery itself) and the external resistance
(that of the wires, etc., leading to the bells or
indicators) in reckoning for any given current from any
cell or cells.</p>

<br />
ON ELECTRIC BELLS AND OTHER SIGNALLING
APPLIANCES.</h2>


<p><a name="SEC_41" id="SEC_41"></a>§ 41. An electric bell is an arrangement of a cylindrical
soft iron core, or cores, surrounded by coils of
insulated copper wire. On causing a current of electricity
to flow round these coils, the iron becomes, <i>for
the time being</i>, powerfully magnetic (see <a href="#SEC_13">§ 13</a>). A piece
of soft iron (known as the <i>armature</i>), supported by a
spring, faces the magnet thus produced. This armature
carries at its free extremity a rod with a bob, clapper or
hammer, which strikes a bell, or gong, when the armature,
under the influence of the pull of the magnet, is
drawn towards it. In connection with the armature
and clapper is a device whereby the flow of the current
can be rapidly interrupted, so that on the cessation of
the current the iron may lose its magnetism, and allow
the spring to withdraw the clapper from against the bell.
This device is known as the "contact breaker" and
varies somewhat in design, according to whether the
bell belongs to the <i>trembling</i>, the <i>single stroke</i>, or the
<i>continuous ringing</i> class.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_42" id="SEC_42"></a>§ 42. In order that the electric bell-fitter may have an<!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
intelligent conception of his work, he should <i>make</i> a
small electric bell himself. By so doing, he will gain
more practical knowledge of what are the requisites of
a good bell, and where defects may be expected in any
he may be called upon to purchase or examine, than he
can obtain from pages of written description. For
this reason I reproduce here (with some trifling additions
and modifications) Mr. G. Edwinson's directions
for making an electric bell:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><i>How to make a bell.</i>&mdash;The old method of doing this
was to take a piece of round iron, bend it into the form
of a horse-shoe, anneal it (by leaving it for several
hours in a bright fire, and allowing it to cool gradually
as the fire goes out), wind on the wire, and fix it as a
magnet on a stout board of beech or mahogany; a bell
was then screwed to another part of the board, a piece
of brass holding the hammer and spring being fastened to
another part. Many bells made upon this plan are still
offered for sale and exchange, but their performance is
always liable to variation and obstruction, from the following
causes:&mdash;To insure a steady, uniform vibratory
stroke on the bell, its hammer must be nicely adjusted
to move within a strictly defined and limited space; the
least fractional departure from this adjustment results in
an unsatisfactory performance of the hammer, and often
a total failure of the magnet to move it. In bells constructed
on the old plan, the wooden base is liable to
expansion and contraction, varying with the change of
weather and the humidity, temperature, etc., of the room<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
in which the bells are placed. Thus a damp, foggy
night may cause the wood to swell and place the hammer
out of range of the bell, while a dry, hot day may alter
the adjustment in the opposite direction. Such failures
as these, from the above causes alone, have often brought
electric bells into disrepute.
Best made bells are, therefore,
now made with metallic
(practically inexpansible)
bases, and it is this kind I
recommend to my readers.</p>

<p><i>The Base</i>, to which all the
other parts are fastened, is
made of &frac34; in. mahogany or
teak, 6 in. by 4 in., shaped
as shown at <a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, with a
smooth surface and French
polished. To this is attached
the metallic base-plate,
which may be cut out
of sheet-iron, or sheet-brass
(this latter is better, as iron
disturbs the action of the
magnet somewhat), and
shaped as shown in <a href="#FIG_18">Fig. 18</a>;
or it may be made of cast-iron, or cast in brass; or a substitute
for it may be made in wrought-iron, or brass, as
shown in <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>. I present these various forms to suit
the varied handicrafts of my readers; for instance, a
worker in sheet metal may find it more convenient to<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
manufacture his bell out of the parts sketched in Figs.
<a href="#FIG_17">17</a>, <a href="#FIG_18">18</a>, <a href="#FIG_20A">20<sup>A</sup></a>, <a href="#FIG_21">21</a>, <a href="#FIG_23">23</a>, <a href="#FIG_24">24<sup>A</sup></a>, and <a href="#FIG_25">25</a>; but, on the other hand,
a smith or engineer might prefer the improved form
shown at <a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>, and select the parts shown at Figs. <a href="#FIG_20A">20<sup>A</sup></a>,
<a href="#Page_22">22</a>, <a href="#FIG_19">19</a>, choosing either to forge the horse-shoe magnet,
<a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>, or to turn up the
two cores, as shown at
<a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a> (<span class="smcap">A</span>), to screw into
the metal base, <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a> <span class="smcap">B</span>,
or to be fastened by nuts,
as shown at <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>. The
result will be the same in
the end, if good workmanship
is employed, and
the proper care taken in
fixing and adjusting the
parts. A tin-plate worker
may even cut his base-plate
out of stout block
tin, and get as good results
as if the bell were made
by an engineer. In some
makes, the base-plate is
cut or stamped out of
thick sheet-iron, in the
form shown by the dotted lines on <a href="#FIG_18">Fig. 18</a>, and
when thus made, the part <span class="smcap">A</span> is turned up at right angles
to form a bracket for the magnet cores, the opposite
projection is cut off, and a turned brass pillar is inserted
at <span class="smcap">B</span> to hold the contact screw, or contact breaker (<a href="#SEC_41">§ 41</a>).<!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Magnet</i> may be formed as shown at <a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>, or at
<a href="#FIG_20A">Fig. 20<sup>A</sup></a>. Its essential parts are: 1st. Two soft iron
cores (in some forms a single core is now employed);
2nd. An iron base, or yoke, to hold the cores together;
3rd. Two bobbins wound with wire. The old form of
magnet is shown at <a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>. In this form the cores and
yoke are made out of one
piece of metal. A length
of round Swedish iron is
bent round in the shape of a
horseshoe; this is rendered
thoroughly soft by annealing,
as explained further on.
It is absolutely essential
that the iron be very soft
and well annealed, otherwise
the iron cores retain
a considerable amount of
magnetism when the current
is not passing, which makes
the bell sluggish in action,
and necessitates a higher
battery power to make it
work (see <a href="#SEC_14">§ 14</a>). Two bobbins of insulated wire
are fitted on the cores, and the magnet is held in
its place by a transverse strip of brass or iron secured
by a wood screw passing between the two bobbins. The
size of the iron, the wire, the bobbins, and the method
of winding is the same as in the form next described,
the only difference being that the length of the iron<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
core, before bending to the horse-shoe form, must be
such as to allow of the two straight portions of the legs
to be 2 in. in length, and stand 1&#8540; apart when bent.
We may now consider the construction of a magnet of
the form shown at <a href="#FIG_20A">Fig. 20<sup>A</sup></a>. To make the cores of
such a magnet, to ring a 2&frac12; in. bell, get two 2 inch
lengths of 5/16 in. best Swedish round iron, straighten
them, smooth them in a lathe, and reduce &frac14; in. of one
end of each to 4/16 of an in., leaving a sharp shoulder,
as shown at <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a> <span class="smcap">A</span>. Next, get a 2-in. length of
angle iron, drill in it two holes 1&#8540; apart, of the exact
diameter of the turned ends of the cores, and rivet these
securely in their places; this may be done by fastening
the cores or legs in a vice whilst they are being rivetted.<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Two holes should be also bored in the other flange to
receive the two screws, which are to hold the magnet to
the base, as shown at <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a> <span class="smcap">B</span>. The magnet is now
quite equal to the horse-shoe form, and must be made
quite soft by annealing. This is done by heating it in
a clear coal fire to a bright red heat, then burying it in
hot ashes, and allowing it to cool gradually for a period
of from 12 to 24 hours; or perhaps a better guide to
the process will be to say, bury the iron in the hot
ashes and leave it there until both it and they are quite
cold. The iron must be brought to a bright cherry red
heat before allowing it to cool, to soften it properly,
and on no account must the cooling be hurried, or the
metal will be <i>hard</i>. Iron is rendered hard by hammering,
by being rapidly cooled, either in cold air or water,<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and hard iron retains magnetism for a longer time than
soft iron. As we wish to have a magnet that will only
act as such when a current of electricity is passing
around it, and shall return to the state of a simple
piece of unmagnetised iron when the current is broken,
we take the precaution of having it of soft iron. Many
bells have failed to act properly, because this precaution
has been neglected, the "residual" (or remaining)
magnetism holding down the
armature after contact has
been broken. When the
magnet has been annealed, its
legs should be polished with a
piece of emery cloth, and the
ends filed up level and smooth.
If it is intended to fasten the
cores into the base-plate, this
also should be annealed, unless
it be made of brass, in which
case a thin strip of soft iron
should connect the back ends
of the two legs before they are
attached to the brass base (an iron yoke is preferable, as
it certainly is conducive to better effects to have a massive
iron yoke, than to have a mere strip as the connecting
piece). It will also be readily understood and conceded
that the cores should be cut longer when they are to be
fastened by nuts, to allow a sufficient length for screwing
the ends to receive the nuts. The length and size of the
legs given above are suitable for a 2&frac12; in. bell only;<!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
for larger bells the size increases 1/16 of an inch, and the
length &frac14; of an inch, for every &frac12; in. increase in the
diameter of the bell.</p>

<p>The <i>Bobbins</i>, on which the wire that serves to carry
the magnetising current is to be wound, next demand
our attention. They may be turned out of boxwood,
ebony, or ebonite, or out of any hard wood strong
enough and dense enough to allow of being turned
down thin in the body, a very necessary requirement to
bring the convolutions of wire as near the coil as possible
without touching it. Some amateurs use the
turned ends of cotton reels or spools, and glue them
on to a tube of paper formed on the cores themselves.
If this tube be afterwards well covered with melted
paraffin wax, the plan answers admirably, but of course
the bobbins become fixtures on the magnets. There
are some persons who are clever enough to make firm
bobbins out of brown paper (like rocket cases), with reel
ends, that can be slipped off and on the magnet cores.
To these I would say, "by all means at your command,
do so if you can." The size of the bobbins for a 2&frac12; in.
bell should be: length 1&frac34; in., diameter of heads &frac34; of an
in., the length increasing &frac14; of an in. and the diameter &#8539; of
an in. for every additional &frac12; in. in the diameter of
the bell. The holes throughout the bobbins should be
of a size to fit the iron cores exactly, and the cores
should project &#8539; of an inch above the end of the
bobbins when these are fitted on. The wire to be
wound on the bobbins is sold by all dealers in electrical
apparatus. It is copper wire, covered with cotton or<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
with silk, to ensure insulation. Mention has already
been made of what is meant by insulation at <a href="#SEC_3">§ 3</a>, but, in
order to refresh the reader's memory, Mr. G. Edwinson's
words are quoted here. "To insulate, as understood
by electricians, means to protect from leakage of
the electric current, by interposing a bad conductor of
electricity between two good conductors, thus insulating<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
or detaching them from electric contact."</p>

<p>The following list will enable my readers to see
at a glance the value of the substances mentioned
here as conductors or insulators, the best conductors
being arranged from the top downwards, and the bad
conductors or insulators opposed to them in similar
order, viz., the worst conductors or best insulators being
at the top:&mdash;</p>

<p>See also the more extended list given at <a href="#SEC_5">§ 5</a> for a more
complete and exact classification.<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen, on reference to the above, that copper
is a good conductor, being excelled by silver alone in
this respect; and that silk and cotton are bad conductors.
When, therefore, a copper wire is bound round with silk
or with cotton, even if two or more strands of such a
covered wire be superimposed, since these are electrically
separated by the non-conducting covering, no escape of
electricity from one strand to the other can take place, and
the strands are said to be insulated. If the copper wire
had been coiled <i>naked</i> round a bobbin, each convolution
touching its neighbour, the current would not have
circled round the whole length of the coils of wire, but
would have leapt across from one coil to the other, and
thus the desired effect would not have been obtained.
A similar result, differing only in degree, would occur
if a badly insulating wire were used, say one in which
the covering had been worn in places, or had been badly
wound, so as to expose patches of bare copper wire. If
the insulation of a wire be suspected, it should be
immersed in hot melted paraffin wax, and then hung up
to drain and cool. The size of wire to be used on a
2&frac12; in. bell should be No. 24 B. W. G., the size falling two
numbers for each &frac12; in. increase in the diameter of
the bell. In these wires the higher the number, the
finer the size, No. 6 being 1/5 and No. 40 being 1/200 of an
inch in diameter. Silk-covered wire has an advantage
over cotton-covered wire, inasmuch as the insulating
material occupies less space, hence the convolutions of
wire lie closer together. This is important, as the
current has less effect on the iron if removed further<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
from it, the decrease being as the <i>square</i> of the distance
that the current is removed from the wire. Magnets
coiled with silk-covered wire admit also of better finish,
but for most purposes cotton-covered wire will give
satisfaction, especially if well paraffined. This wire
must be wound on the bobbins, from end to end
regularly, with the coils side by side, as a reel of cotton
is wound. This may be done on a lathe, but a little
practice will be necessary before the inexperienced hand
can guide the wire in a regular manner. If, however,
the spool of wire have a metal rod passed up its centre,
and this be held in the hand at a distance of a foot or
more from the bobbin on the lathe, the wire will almost
guide itself on, providing the guiding hand be allowed
to follow its course. With a little care, the wire for
these little magnets may be wound entirely by hand.
Before commencing to wind on the bobbins, just measure
off 8 in. of the wire (not cutting it off) and coil this
length around a pencil, to form a small coil or helix.
The pencil may then be withdrawn from the helix thus
formed, which serves to connect the wire with one of the
points of contact. This free end is to be fastened outside
the bobbin by a nick in the head; or the &#8539; in.
length, before being formed into a helix, may be
pushed through a small hole made on the head of the
bobbin, so that 8 in. project <i>outside</i> the bobbin,
which projecting piece may be coiled into a helix as
above described. The wire should now be wound
exactly as a reel of cotton is wound, in close coils from
end to end, and then back again, until three layers of<!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
wire have been laid on, so that the coiling finishes at the
opposite end to that at which it began. To prevent this
uncoiling, it should be fastened by tying down tightly
with a turn or two of strong silk. The wire should now
be cut from the hank, leaving about 2 in. of free
wire projecting at the finishing end of each bobbin. In
cases where many bobbins have to be wound, either for
bells, for relays, or for indicator coils, a device similar to
that illustrated at <a href="#FIG_21A">Fig. 21 <span class="smcap">A</span></a> may be employed. This
<i>electric bobbin winder</i> consists in a table which can be
stood on a lathe or near any other driving wheel. Two
carriers, <span class="smcap">C C</span>, somewhat similar to the back centre and
poppet head of a lathe, hollow inside, and furnished
with a spring and sliding piston spindle, stand one at
each end of this table. The sliding spindle of the one
carries at its extremity a pulley, <span class="smcap">A</span>, by means of which
motion can be transmitted from the band of the driving
wheel. The sliding spindles, <span class="smcap">B B</span>, are fitted with recesses
and screws, <span class="smcap">H H H H</span>, by means of which the temporary
wooden cores, or the permanent iron cores, of the bobbins
can be held while the bobbins are being wound. The
bobbin is placed as shown at <span class="smcap">D</span>; a flat piece of metal, <span class="smcap">E</span>,
hinged at <span class="smcap">G</span>, presses against the bobbin, owing to the
spring <span class="smcap">F</span>. The centre figure shows details of the carrier,
<span class="smcap">C</span>, in section. At the bottom is shown the spool of wire
on a standard <span class="smcap">L</span>. The wire passes from this spot between
the two indiarubber rollers, <span class="smcap">M M</span>, on to the bobbin <span class="smcap">D</span>.</p>

<p>When the bobbins have been wound, they may be
slipped over the magnet cores. They should fit pretty
tightly; if they do not, a roll of paper may be put round<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the magnet cores, to ensure their not slipping when
the bell is at work. The helix ends of the bobbins
should stand uppermost, as shown at <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22 <span class="smcap">A</span></a>. A short
length of the lower free ends of wire (near the base or
yoke) should now be bared of their covering, cleaned<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
with emery paper, twisted together tightly, as shown at
<a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22 <span class="smcap">B</span></a>, soldered together, and any excess of wire cut off
with a sharp pair of pliers. To prevent any chance
electrical leakage between this bared portion of the wire
and the iron, it should be carefully coated with a little
melted guttapercha, or Prout's electric glue.</p>

<p>Of course, if the operator has any skill at winding, he

wire, thus avoiding joins, taking care that the direction

<p>The part that next claims our consideration is the<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<i>armature</i>, with its fittings. The armature is made out of
5/16 square bar iron, of the best quality, soft, and well
annealed, and filed up smooth and true. The proportionate
length is shown at Figs. <a href="#FIG_23">23</a> and <a href="#FIG_24">24</a>; and the
size of the iron for other bells is regulated in the same
ratio as that of the cores. Two methods of making and
attaching the springs and hammers are shown. <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a>
shows the section of an armature fitted with back spring
and contact spring in one piece. This is cut out of hard
sheet-brass, as wide as the armature, filed or hammered
down to the desired degree of springiness, then filed up
true on the edges. It may be attached to the iron of the
armature, either by soldering, by rivetting, or by means<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of two small screws. Rivetting is, perhaps, the best mode,
as it is not liable to shake loose by the vibration of the
hammer. The spring at its shank end may be screwed
or rivetted to the bracket. Mr. Edwinson considers
this the better form of contact spring. The other form
is made in two pieces, as shown at <a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>, where two
strips of hard brass are cut off, of the width of
the armature, and the edges filed. A slot is then
cut in the back end of the armature to receive the two
brass strips, and these are soldered into it. The top
strip is then bent back over the armature
to form the contact-spring, the other strip
being soldered or rivetted to a small
bracket of angle brass. In either case
a short rod of stout hard brass wire is
rivetted or screwed into the free end of
the armature, and to the end of this rod
is screwed or soldered the metal bead,
or bob, which forms the hammer or
"clapper" of the bell. The next portion
to be made is the contact pillar, or bracket, with its
screw, as shown at <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>. This may either be a
short stout pillar of &frac14; in. brass rod, about 1 in. high,
tapped on one side to receive the screw, which should be
fitted with a back nut; or it may, as shown in the figure,
be made out of a stout piece of angle brass. The exact
size and length of the screw is immaterial; it must, however,
be long enough to reach (when put in its place
behind the contact spring) the spring itself, and still have
a few threads behind the back nut to spare. The screw<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
should be nicely fitted to the pillar, and the lock nut
should clench it well, as when once the adjustment of
the parts is found which gives good ringing, it is advisable
that no motion should take place, lest the perfection
of ringing be interfered with. Some makers use a "set
screw" at the side of the pillar wherewith to hold the
contact screw; others split the pillar and "spring" it
against the contact screw; but, all things considered, the
back nut gives the greatest satisfaction. When the bell
is in action, a tiny spark is produced at every make and
break of contact between the contact spring and this
screw. This spark soon corrodes the end of the screw
and the back of the spring if brass alone is used, as this
latter rusts under the influence of the spark. To
prevent this, a piece of platinum must be soldered or
rivetted to the spring, at the point where the screw
touches, as shown at <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>, and also at the extremity
of the contact screw itself. It
is better to rivet the platinum
than to solder it, as the platinum
is very apt to absorb the solder,
in which case it rusts quickly, and the goodness of
the contact is soon spoiled, when the bell ceases to
ring. To rivet the platinum piece on to the spring,
as shown at <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>, it is only needful to procure
a short length of No. 16 platinum wire, say &#8539; in.,
then, having drilled a corresponding hole at the
desired spot in the contact spring, put the platinum wire
half way through the hole, and give it one or two sharp
blows on an anvil, with a smooth (pened) hammer.<!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>This will at once rivet it in its place, and spread it
sufficiently to make a good surface for contact. The
screw must likewise be tipped with platinum, by having
a small hole bored in the centre of its extremity, of the
same diameter as the platinum wire, which must then
be pushed in, and rivetted by hammering the end, and
burring the sides of the screw. Whichever method be
adopted, care must be taken that the platinum tip on
the screw and the speck on the contact spring are
adjusted so as to touch exactly in their centres. It will
be hardly worth while for the amateur
to cast or even turn up his own bells
(which are generally of the class known
as clock gongs), as these can now be
procured so cheaply already nickelled
(<a href="#FIG_28">see Fig. 28</a>). The bell must be
adjusted on its pillar (<a href="#FIG_29">see Fig. 29<sup>A</sup></a>),
which is itself screwed into a hole in
the base-plate, where it is held by a
nut. The adjustment of the bell is effected by placing
it over the shoulder of the pillar, and then clenching it
down by screwing over it one or other of the nuts shown
at <a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>. The bell should clear the base, and should
be at such a height as to be struck on its edge by the
hammer or clapper attached to the armature, Figs. <a href="#FIG_23">23</a>
and <a href="#FIG_24">24</a>. We still need, to complete our bell, two
binding screws, which may take either of the forms shown
at <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>; and an insulating washer, or collar, made
of ebonite or boxwood, soaked in melted paraffin, to
prevent the contact pillar (<a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>) making electrical<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
contact with the metal base. The best shape to be given
to these washers is shown at <a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>. They consist in
two thin circlets of wood or ebonite, that will just not
meet when dropped, one on the one side, and one on the
other of the hole through which the shank of the contact
pillar passes when set up on the base-plate. If a wooden
base be used below the metal base-plate,
then only one washer, or collar, need be
used&mdash;that is, the one <i>above</i>&mdash;since the
screw of the pillar will pass into the wood,
and this is not a conductor. If the metal
base alone be used, both washers must be
employed, and a small nut (not so large as the washer)
used to tighten up and hold the pillar firm and immovable
in its place opposite the contact spring.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 30.</p>
</div>

<p>Having now all the parts at hand, we can proceed to
fit them together, which is done as follows:&mdash;The bell
pillar, with its bell attached, is fastened by its shank<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
into the hole shown near <span class="smcap">B</span>, <a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, where it is screwed
up tight by the square nut shown at <a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29 <i>c</i></a>. In the
same manner, we must fasten the contact pillar, or bracket,
shown at <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24 <span class="smcap">A</span></a>. Whichever form be used, we must
take great care that it be insulated from metallic contact
with the metal base-plate by washers, as shown at
<a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a> (similar washers must be used for the two binding
screws if the <i>whole</i> base-plate be made in metal).
This being done, the metal frame, <a href="#FIG_18">Fig. 18</a>, is put in
position on the wooden base, as shown at <a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, and
screwed down thereto by the screws indicated at <i>s s s</i>.
The magnet may then be screwed down to the metal
frame as shown. The small bracket of angle brass
marked <span class="smcap">B</span>, in Figs. <a href="#FIG_23">23</a> and <a href="#FIG_24">24</a>, is next screwed into its
place; that is, in such a position that the armature stands
squarely facing the poles of the electro-magnet, but not
quite touching them (say 1/16 of an inch for a 2&frac12; in.
bell). In setting up this and the contact pillar, the
greatest care must be taken that the platinum tip of the
contact screw, <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>, should touch lightly the centre
of the platinum speck at the back of the spring, Figs.
<a href="#FIG_23">23</a> and <a href="#FIG_24">24</a>, shown full size at <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<p>The free ends of the helically coiled electro-magnet
wires should now be inserted into short lengths of small
indiarubber tubing (same as used for feeding bottles), the
extremities being drawn through and 1 in. of the copper
wire bared of its covering for the purpose of making
good metallic contact with the connections. One of these
ends is to be soldered, or otherwise metallically connected,
to the angle brass carrying the armature, spring<!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and clapper, the other being similarly connected with
the left-hand binding-screw, shown at <a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>. Another
short length of wire (also enclosed in rubber tubing)
must be arranged to connect the contact screw pillar
<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, with the right-hand binding-screw. When
this has been done, we may proceed to test the working
of the bell by connecting up the binding screws with
the wires proceeding from a freshly-charged Leclanché
cell. If all have been properly done, and the connections
duly made, the armature should begin to vibrate
at once, causing the "bob," or hammer, to strike the
bell rapidly; that is, provided the platinum tipped screw
touches the platinum speck on the contact spring.
Should this not be the case, the screw must be turned
until the platinum tip touches the platinum speck. The
armature will now begin to vibrate. It may be that
the clapper runs too near the bell, so that it gives a
harsh, thuddy buzz instead of a clear, ringing sound; or,
possibly, the clapper is "set" too far from the bell to
strike it. In either case a little bending of the brass
wire carrying the clapper (either from or towards the
bell, as the case may dictate) will remedy the defect.
It is also possible that the armature itself may have
been set too near, or too far from the electro-magnet.
In the latter case, the clapper will not vibrate strongly
enough, in the former the vibration will be too short,
and the clapper may even stick to the poles of the
electros, especially if these have not been carefully annealed.
A little bending of the spring, to or from the
magnets, will remedy these deficiencies, unless the dis<!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tance
be very much too great, in which case the bending
of the spring would take the platinum tip out of the
centre of the platinum speck.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_43" id="SEC_43"></a>§ 43. Having thus constructed an efficient electric bell
we may proceed to study its action and notice some of
the defects to which it may
be subject. In the first place,
if we connect up the bell with
the battery as shown in <a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>,
viz., the left-hand binding-screw
with the wire proceeding
from the carbon of the
Leclanché, and the right-hand
screw with the wire from the
zinc, then, if the platinum
tipped screw touches the
platinum speck, at the back
of the contact spring, a current
of electricity flows from the
left-hand binding-screw all
round the coils of the electro-magnets,
passes along the
contact spring and platinum
speck, thence to the platinum
tipped screw along the short
length of wire to the right-hand binding-screw,
whence it returns to the zinc element of the battery,
thus completing the circuit. The current, in thus
passing around the electro-magnet cores, converts
them, <i>pro tem.</i>, into a powerful magnet (see <a href="#SEC_13">§ 13</a>); con<!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>sequently,
the armature, with its contact spring and
hammer, is pulled towards the electro-magnets and at
the same time gives a blow to the bell. Now, if instead
of having the platinum speck attached to a flexible
spring, it had been attached bodily to the rigid iron
armature, directly the electro-magnets felt the influence
of the current, the platinum speck would have also been
pulled out of contact with the platinum screw, therefore
the electro-magnet cores would have <i>immediately</i> lost
their magnetism (see <a href="#SEC_13">§ 13</a>, last five lines). This would
have been disadvantageous, for two reasons: 1st, because
the <i>stroke</i> of the hammer would have been very
short, and consequently the ring of the bell very weak;
and, 2nd, because, as even the softest iron requires
some appreciable time for the electric current to flow
round it to magnetise it to its full capacity, it would need
a much greater battery power to produce a given stroke,
if the contact were so very short. The use of an elastic
contact spring is, therefore, just to lengthen the time of
contact. But the electro-magnets, even when the flexible
spring is used, do actually pull the platinum speck
out of contact with the platinum screw. When this
takes place, the circuit is broken, and no more current
can flow round the electro-magnets, the spring reasserts
its power, and the contact is again made between the
contact screw and contact spring, to be again rapidly
broken, each break and make contact being accompanied
by a correspondingly rapid vibration of the armature,
with its attendant clapper, which thus sets up that
characteristic rapid ringing which has earned for these<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
bells the name of trembling, chattering, or vibrating
bells.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_44" id="SEC_44"></a>§ 44. From a careful consideration of the last two
sections it will be evident that the possible defects of
electric bells may be classed under four heads: viz., 1st,
Bad contacts; 2nd, Bad adjustment of the parts; 3rd,
Defective insulation; 4th, Warpage or shrinkage of
base. We will consider these in the above order.
Firstly, then, as to bad contacts. Many operators are
content with simply turning the terminal wires round
the base of the binding-screws. Unless the binding-screws
are firmly held down on to the wires by means
of a back nut, a great loss is sure to occur at these
points, as the wires may have been put on with sweaty
hands, when a film of oxide soon forms, which greatly
lowers the conductivity of the junction. Again, at the
junction points of the wires with the contact angle brass
and contact pillar, some workmen solder the junctions,
using "killed spirits" as a flux. A soldered contact is
certainly the best, electrically speaking, but "killed
spirits," or chloride of zinc, should never be used as a
flux in any apparatus or at any point that cannot be
washed in abundance of water, as chloride of zinc is very
<i>deliquescent</i> (runs to water), rottens the wire, and spoils
the insulation of the adjacent parts. If solder be used
at any parts, let <i>resin</i> be used as a flux. Even if any
excess of resin remain on the work, it does no harm
and does not destroy the insulation of any of the other
portions. Another point where bad contact may arise
is at the platinum contacts. Platinum is a metal which<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
does not rust easily, even under the influence of the
electric spark given at the point of contact. Therefore,
it is preferred to every other metal (except, perhaps,
iridium) for contact breakers. Platinum is an expensive
metal, the retail price being about 30s. an ounce, and as
it is nearly twice as heavy as lead (Lead 11. Platinum
21·5) very little goes to an ounce. For cheap bells,
therefore, there is a great temptation to use some other
white metal, such as silver, german silver, platinoid, etc.</p>

<p>The tip of the platinum screw may be tested for its
being veritably platinum in the following mode: Touch
the tip with the stopper of a bottle containing aquafortis,
so as to leave a tiny drop on the extreme point of the
suspected platinum. If it boils up green, or turns black,
it is <i>not</i> platinum; if it remains unaltered, it may be
silver or platinum. After it has stood on the tip for a
minute, draw it along a piece of white paper, so as to
produce a streak of the acid. Expose the paper for a
few minutes to sunlight. If the streak turns violet or
pinky violet, the metal is <i>silver</i>; if the paper simply shows
a slightly yellowish streak, the metal is platinum. The
tip of the platinum screw must be carefully dried and
cleaned after this trial before being replaced.</p>

<p>Secondly, as to bad adjustment. It is evident that
the magnets and the armature must stand at a certain
distance apart to give the best effects with a given
battery power. The distance varies from 1/24 in. in the very
smallest, to &#8539; in. in large bells. Sometimes (but only in
very badly made instruments) the armature adheres to
the poles of the electro-magnet. This is due to <i>residual</i><!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<i>magnetism</i> (see <a href="#SEC_14">§ 14</a>), and points to hard or unannealed
iron in the cores or armature. As a make-shift, this
defect may be partially remedied by pasting a thin piece
of paper over that surface of the armature which faces
the poles of the electro-magnets. Another bad adjustment
is when the platinum screw does not touch fairly
on the centre of the platinum speck, but touches the
spring or the solder. Rust is then sure to form, which
destroys the goodness of the contact. To adjust the
contact spring at the right distance from the platinum
screw, hold the hammer against the bell or gong. The
armature should now <i>just not touch</i> the poles of the
electro-magnet. Now screw up the platinum screw
until it <i>clears</i> the contact spring by about the thickness
of a sheet of brown paper (say 1/50 of an inch). Let the
hammer go, and notice whether the contact spring makes
good contact with the platinum screw. This may be
tried by the Leclanché cell as well, so as to make sure
of the character of the <i>ringing</i>. When this has been
satisfactorily adjusted the back-nut or set screw may be
tightened, to insure that the vibration of the hammer
shall not alter the adjustment. It sometimes happens
that the spring that bears the armature is itself either
too strong (or set back too far) or too weak. In the
former case, the electro-magnet cannot pull the armature
with sufficient force to give a good blow; in the latter,
the spring cannot return the armature, with its attendant
contact spring, back to its place against the platinum
screw. To ascertain which of these two defects obtains,
it is only necessary, while the bell is in action, to press<!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the spring lightly with a bit of wire, first <i>towards</i> and
then <i>away</i> from the electro-magnets. If the ringing is
improved in the first case, the spring is too strong; if
improvement takes place in the latter case, the spring
is too weak. The third source of inefficient action,
defective insulation, is not likely to occur in a newly-made
bell, except by gross carelessness. Still, it may
be well to point out where electrical leakage is likely to
occur, and how its presence may be ascertained, localized,
and remedied. If the wire used to wind the electro-magnet
be old, badly covered, or bared in several places
in winding, it probably will allow the current to "short
circuit," instead of traversing the whole length of the
coils. If this be the case, the magnet will be very weak:
the magnet of a 2&frac12;-in. bell should be able to sustain
easily a 1 lb. weight attached by a piece of string to a
smooth piece of &frac12;-in. square iron placed across its poles,
when energized by a single pint Leclanché cell. If it
will not do this, the insulation may be suspected. If
the wire has been wound on the bare cores (without
bobbins), as is sometimes done, bared places in the wire
may be touching the iron. This may be ascertained
by connecting one pole of a bottle bichromate, or other
powerful battery, with one of the wires of the electro-magnet
coils, and drawing the other pole of the battery
across the clean iron faces of the electro-magnet poles.
If there is any leakage, sparks will appear on making
and breaking contact. Nothing but unwinding and
rewinding with a well covered wire can remedy these
defects. The other points where the insulation may<!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
be defective are between the binding screws and the
base, if this be all of metal; or between the contact
spring block and the base, and the contact pillar. It is also
probable (if the connecting wires have not been covered
with indiarubber tubing, as recommended) that leakage
may be taking place between these wires and some
portion of the metal work of the base or frame. This
must be carefully examined, and if any point of contact
be observed, a little piece of Prout's elastic glue,
previously heated, must be inserted at the suspected
places. With regard to the binding screws, if they
stand on the wooden base, their insulation (unless the
base be very damp indeed) will be sufficiently good;
but if the base is entirely metallic, then ebonite or
boxwood washers must be used to insulate them from
contact with the base-plate. With regard to the contact
spring block and the platinum screw pillar, it is <i>permissible</i>
that one or the other should not be insulated
from the base or frame; but one or the other <i>must</i> be
insulated by means of ebonite or other insulating washers.
Personally, I prefer to insulate both; but in many really
good bells only the platinum screw pillar is thus insulated.
Any such leakage can be immediately detected
by holding one pole of a powerful battery against the
suspected binding-screw, or block, or pillar, and while
in this position, drawing the other pole across some bare
iron portion of the frame or metal base. Sparks will
appear if there is any leakage.</p>

<p>The fourth defect&mdash;that is, warpage or shrinkage of the
base&mdash;can only occur in badly-made bells, in which the<!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
entire base is of wood. A cursory examination will
show whether the board is warped or swollen, or whether
it has shrunk. Warping or swelling will throw the
electro-magnet too far from the armature, or "set" the
pillar out of place; shrinkage, on the contrary, will bring
the parts too close together and jamb the magnets, the
armature, and the contact pillar into an unworkable
position.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_45" id="SEC_45"></a>§ 45. Before quitting the subject of the defects of
bells, it may not be out of place to mention that no bell
that is set to do real work should be fitted up without a
cover or case. The dust which is sure to accumulate,
not to speak of damp and fumes, etc., will certainly
militate against good contacts and good action if this
important point be neglected. The cover or case
generally takes the form of a shallow box, as shown
at <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>, and may be made from &frac14;-in. teak, mahogany,
or walnut, dovetailed together and well
polished. It is fastened to the base in
the same manner as the sides of a
Dutch clock, by means of studs, hooks
and eyes. At the bottom of the box
is cut a slot, of sufficient width and
length to admit the play of the hammer
shank.</p>

<p>In the annexed table is given a
general idea of the proportion which
should be observed in the construction of
bells of different sizes. It must be noted
that if the bells are to be used at long distances from the<!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
battery, rather more of a finer gauge of wire must be
employed to wind the magnets than that herein recommended,
unless, indeed, <i>relays</i> be used in conjunction
with the bells.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_47" id="SEC_47"></a>§ 47. We can now glance at several modifications in
the shape and mode of action of electric bells and their
congeners. Taking Figs. <a href="#FIG_33A">33 <span class="smcap">A</span></a> and <a href="#FIG_33B"><span class="smcap">B</span></a> as our typical
forms of trembling bell, the first notable modification
is one by means of which the bell is made to give a
single stroke only, for each contact with the battery.
This form, which is known as the "single stroke bell,"
lends itself to those cases in which it may be required
to transmit preconcerted signals; as also where it is
desired to place many bells in one circuit. <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>
illustrates the construction of the single stroke bell.
It differs from the trembling bell in the mode in which
the electro-magnet is connected up to the binding
screws. In the trembling bell, <a href="#FIG_33A">Fig. 33</a>, the circuit is
completed through the platinum screw pillar, to the
binding screw marked <span class="smcap">Z</span>, hence the circuit is rapidly made<!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and broken as long as by any means contact is made
with the battery, and the binding screws <span class="smcap">L</span> and <span class="smcap">Z</span>. But
in the single stroke bell, <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>, the wires from the
electro-magnet are connected directly to the two binding
screws <span class="smcap">L</span> and <span class="smcap">Z</span>, so that when contact is made with
the battery, the armature is drawn to the poles of the
electro-magnet, and kept there
so long as the battery current
passes. By this means, only
one stroke or blow is given to
the bell for each contact of the
battery. Of course, directly
the connection with the battery
is broken, the spring which
carries the armature and clapper
flies back ready to be
again attracted, should connection
again be made with
the battery. To regulate the
distance of the armature from
the poles of the electro-magnets,
a set screw <span class="smcap">Q</span> takes
the place of the platinum screw
in the ordinary form, while to
prevent the hammer remaining in contact with the bell
(which would produce a dull thud and stop the clear
ring of the bell), a stop (<i>g</i>) is set near the end of the
armature, or two studs are fixed on the tips of the poles
of the electro-magnets. The mode of adjusting this
kind of bell, so as to obtain the best effect, differs a<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
little from that employed in the case of the trembling
bell. The armature must be pressed towards the poles
of the electro-magnets, until it rests against the stop
or studs. A piece of wood or cork may be placed
between the armature and the set screw <span class="smcap">Q</span>, to retain
the armature in this position, while the rod carrying the
hammer or clapper is being bent (if required) until
the hammer just clears the bell. If it touches the bell,
a thud instead of a ring is the result; if it is set off too
far, the ring will be too weak. The armature can now
be released, by removing the wood or cork, and the set
screw <span class="smcap">Q</span> driven forwards or backwards until the best
effect is produced when tested with the battery. The
tension of the armature spring must be carefully looked
to in these single stroke bells. If it is too strong, the
blow will be weak; if too weak, the hammer trembles,
so that a clear single stroke is not obtainable, as the
spring <i>chatters</i>.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_48" id="SEC_48"></a>§ 48. <i>The continuous ringing bell</i> is the modification
which next demands our attention. In this, the ringing
action, when once started by the push,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or other contact
maker, having been touched, continues either until the
battery is exhausted, or until it is stopped by the
person in charge. The great use of this arrangement<!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
is self-evident in cases of burglar alarms, watchman's
alarms, etc., as the continuous ringing gives notice that
the "call" has not received attention. The continuous
ringing bell differs but little from the ordinary trembling
bell. The chief difference lies in the addition of an
automatic device whereby contact is kept up with the
battery, even after the "push" contact has ceased. As
it is desirable for the person in charge to be able to
stop the ringing at will, without proceeding to the place
where the "push" stands, so it is not usual to make
the continuous ringing arrangement dependent on the
"push," though, of course, this could be done, by
causing it to engage in a catch, which would keep up
the contact, when once made. Continuous ringing bells
may be conveniently divided into two classes; viz.,
1st, those in which a device is attached to the framework
of the bell; which device, when once upset by the
first stroke of the bell, places the bell in direct communication
with the battery independent of the "push"
or usual contact; and 2ndly, those in which a separate
device is used, for the same purpose. This latter
arrangement admits of the use of an ordinary trembling
bell.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 36.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a> illustrates the action of bells of the first
class. In the first place it will be noticed that there
are three binding screws instead of two, as in the
ordinary pattern, one marked <span class="smcap">C</span> connected as usual
with the carbon element of the battery; another
marked <span class="smcap">L</span>, which connects with line wire, and a third,
<span class="smcap">Z</span>, connected by means of a branch wire (shunt wire),<!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
proceeding from the zinc of the battery. It will be
seen, that if the battery current is by means of the
push caused to flow through the coils of the electro-magnets,
the armature is attracted as usual by them,
and in moving towards them, releases and lets fall the
lever contact, which, resting on the contact screw,
completes the circuit between <span class="smcap">Z</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>, so that the
bell is in direct communication with its battery,
independently of the push. Hence the bell continues
ringing, until the lever is replaced. This can be<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
done, either by pulling a check string (like a bell-pull)
attached to an eye in the lever, or by means of a
press-button and counter-spring; as shown in <a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>,
<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 37.</p>
</div>

<p>In continuous ringing bells of the second class, a
detent similar to that shown at <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a> <span class="smcap">D</span> is used, but
this, instead of being actuated by the electro-magnet
belonging to the bell itself, is controlled by a separate
and entirely independent electro-magnet, which, as it
may be wound with many coils of fine wire, and have
a specially light spring for the armature, can be made
very sensitive. This second electro-magnet, which<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
serves only to make contact with a battery, is known
as a <i>Relay</i>, and is extensively employed in many cases
where it is desired to put one or more batteries into,
or out of circuit, from a distance. The relay may be
looked upon as an automatic hand, which can be made
to repeat at a distant point contacts made or broken
by hand at a nearer one. <a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a> shows this arrange<!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ment,
attached to the same base board as the bell itself.
On contact being made with the push, the current
enters at <span class="smcap">C</span>, circulates round the cores of the relay, thus
converting it into a magnet. The armature <i>a</i> is thereby
pulled to the magnet, and in so doing releases the detent
lever, which falls on the contact screw, thus at one
and the same time breaking the circuit through the
relay, and making the circuit through the bell magnets
<span class="smcap">B B´</span>, back to the battery by <span class="smcap">Z</span>. A second modification
of this mode of causing an ordinary bell to ring continuously
is shown at <a href="#FIG_38">Fig. 38</a>, the peculiar form of<!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
relay used therewith being illustrated at <a href="#FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>.
Here, the relay is placed on a separate base board of
its own, and could, if necessary, be thrown out of
circuit altogether, by means of a <i>switch</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> so that the
bell can be used as an ordinary bell or continuous
action at will. It will be noticed that the relay has
in this sketch only one core. But the delicacy of the
action is not impaired thereby, as the armature, by
means of the steel spring <i>s</i>, is made to form part and
parcel of the magnet, so that it becomes magnetised
as well as the core, and is attracted with more force
than it would be, if it were magnetically insulated.
The battery current enters by the wires <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">W</span>, passes
round the coils of the electro-magnet, and returns by <span class="smcap">Z</span>.
In so doing it energises the electro-magnet <span class="smcap">E</span>, which
immediately attracts its armature <span class="smcap">A</span>. The forward
movement of the armature <span class="smcap">A</span>, releases the pivoted
arm <span class="smcap">L</span>, to which is attached a platinum-tipped contact
prong <span class="smcap">P</span>. This, it will be noticed, is in metallic connection
with the pillar <span class="smcap">P'</span>, and with the base, and,
therefore, through the wire <span class="smcap">W</span>, with the battery. When
the arm <span class="smcap">L</span> falls, the contact prong completes the circuit
to the bell, through the insulated pillar <span class="smcap">X</span>. The relay
is thus thrown out of the circuit at the same time
that the bell is thrown in. A device similar to those
illustrated at <a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a> can be employed to reset the
arm <span class="smcap">L</span>.</p>

<p>A rather more complicated arrangement for continuous
bell ringing is shown at <a href="#FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>. It is known<!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as Callow's, and is peculiarly adapted to ringing several
bells from one attachment, etc. Owing to the relay
in this form being wound with two sets of wires, it
takes a little more battery power; but this disadvantage
is compensated by its many good points.
The following description, taken from F. C. Allsop's
papers in the <i>English Mechanic</i>, will render the working
of Callow's attachment perfectly clear. "When the
button of the push <span class="smcap">P</span> is pressed, the current in
the main circuit flows from the positive pole <span class="smcap">C</span> of the
battery <span class="smcap">D</span> through the relay coil <i>a</i>, and thence by
the wire <i>d</i> and push <span class="smcap">P</span>, to the zinc of the battery.
This attracts the armature <span class="smcap">A</span> of the relay <span class="smcap">R</span>, closing the
local bell circuit, the current flowing from <span class="smcap">C</span> of the
battery to armature <span class="smcap">A</span> of the relay <span class="smcap">R</span>, through contact
post <i>p</i>, terminal <span class="smcap">L</span> of the bell, through bell to terminal
<span class="smcap">Z</span>, and thence by the wire <i>g</i> to the zinc of the battery.
Part of the current also flows along the wire from the
bell terminal <span class="smcap">L</span> through the relay coil <i>b</i> and switch <span class="smcap">W</span>,
to terminal <span class="smcap">Z</span> of the bell, thus keeping the armature<!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of the relay down, after the main circuit (through the
push) has been broken; the bell continuing to ring
until the shunt circuit is broken by moving the arm
of the switch <span class="smcap">W</span> over to the opposite (or non-contact)
side. The bell can also be stopped by short circuiting
the relay, which can be effected by an ordinary push.
It will be seen that more than one bell can be rung
from the same attachment, and the bell can, by moving
the arm of the switch <span class="smcap">W</span>, be made continuous ringing
or not, at will. If the arm of the switch is moved
over to the opposite side to which it is shown in the
figure, the shunt circuit of the bell through the relay
is broken, and the bell will ring only so long as the
button of the push is kept in. This continuous arrangement
is very convenient for front doors, etc., where
trouble is experienced in securing immediate attention
to the summons. Instead of being taken to the switch,
as in <a href="#FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>, the two wires are taken to a contact piece
fixed on the side of the door frame, and so arranged
that when the door is opened, it either short circuits
or breaks the shunt circuit: thus when the push is
pressed, the bell rings until the door is opened, the
continual ringing of the bell insuring prompt attention."</p>

<p>Mr. H. Thorpe, of 59, Theobald's Road, London, has
devised a very ingenious arrangement for the continuous
ringing of one or more bells for a stated period of
time. This is shown at <a href="#FIG_40A">Fig. 40 <span class="smcap">A</span></a>. It is set in action
by pulling the ring outside the bottom of the core.
The bell or bells then start ringing, as contact is<!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
established and kept up. The novelty lies in the fact
that the duration of the contact, and consequently of
the ringing, can be accurately timed from 5 seconds
to 30 seconds, by merely inserting a pin at different
holes in the rod, as shown. After
the bells have rung the required
time the instrument automatically
resets itself.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_49" id="SEC_49"></a>§ 49. The modifications we are
now about to consider, differ from
the ordinary bell, either in the
shape or material of the bell
itself, the relative disposition of
the parts, or some structural
detail; but not upon the introduction
of any new principle.
The most striking is certainly the
Jensen bell, which is shown in
section at <a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 41.</p>
</div>

<p>According to Mr. Jensen's system of electric bells,
the bell may take any desired form, that of the ordinary
church bell being preferred, and the electro-magnetic
apparatus is placed entirely inside the bell itself. To
attain this end the electro-magnetic apparatus must
be compact in form. A single electro-magnet has pole
pieces at each end opposite to which an armature is
suspended from a pivot and balanced by the hammer
of the bell. At the back of the armature there may be
a make and break arrangement, whereby a continuous
succession of strokes is effected, or this may be omitted,<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
in which case a single stroke is given when the contact
with the battery is made, or both may be effected by
separate wires, make contact with one wire, and a single
stroke is struck; make it with the other and the current
passes through the make and break and a succession
of strokes is heard. When the contact-breaker is used,
it is so arranged that a slight rub is caused at every
stroke, so keeping the contact clean. The flexible
break, with the ingenious wiping contact, is a great
improvement over the ordinary screw, which often
becomes disarranged.</p>

<p>The form of the magnet is such that a considerable<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
degree of magnetic force is caused by a comparatively
small battery power. The electro-magnetic apparatus
being within the bell the latter forms a very effective
and handsome shield for the former. Not only can the
bell shield the electro-magnet from wet but the whole
of the conducting wires as well.</p>

<p>The bell may be screwed to a tube through which
passes the conducting wire, which makes contact with
an insulated metallic piece in the centre of the top
of the bell. Both the wire and the contact piece are as
completely shielded from the weather as if within the
bell itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 327px;">
<a name="FIG_42" id="FIG_42"></a>
<img src="images/i_113.png" width="327" height="400" alt="Fig. 42." title="Jensen bell, exterior" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 42.</p>
</div>

<p>The great point of departure is the discarding of
the unsightly magnet box, and the hemispherical bell
(<i>see</i> <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>), and substituting a bell of the Church
type (see <a href="#FIG_42">Fig. 42</a>), and placing inside it an electro-magnet
specially arranged. The inventors use a single
solenoidal magnet of a peculiar construction, by which
the armature is attracted by both poles simultaneously.
By this means less than half the usual quantity of wire
is required, thus reducing the external resistance of the
circuit one half. Moreover the armature, besides being
magnetised by induction, as acted on in the ordinary
method of making electric bells, is by Messrs. Jensen's
plan directly polarised by being in actual magnetic
contact by the connection of the gimbal (which is one
piece with the armature) with the core iron of their
magnet. It is thus induced to perform the largest
amount of work with the smallest electro-motive force.
Instead of the armature and clapper being in a<!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
straight line attached to a rigid spring, which necessitates
a considerable attractive power to primarily give it
momentum, in the Jensen Bell the armature and
hammer are in the form of an inverted U, and being
perfectly balanced from the point of suspension, the
lines of force from a comparatively small magnetic
field suffice to set this improved form of armature into
instant regular vibration. By using a flexible break
and make arrangement instead of the usual armature
spring and set screw (at best of most uncertain action),
it is found that a much better result is attained, and
by this device the armature can be set much nearer
the poles of the magnet with sufficient traverse of the
hammer. This is in strict accordance with the law
of inverse squares, which holds that the force exerted
between two magnetic poles is inversely proportionate
to the square of the distance between them, or, in other
words, that magnets increase proportionately in their
power of attraction as they decrease in the square of
the distance. It will now be seen why these bells
require so little battery power to ring them: firstly,
the armature and hammer are so perfectly balanced
as to offer but little resistance; secondly, the external
resistance to the current is reduced; and thirdly, the
best possible use is made of the electro-magnetic force
at disposal.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_50" id="SEC_50"></a>§ 50. The next modification which demands attention
is the so-called "Circular bell." This differs from the
ordinary form only in having the action entirely covered
by the dome. Except, perhaps, in point of appearance,<!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
this presents no advantages to that. The bells known
as "Mining bells" resemble somewhat in outward appearance
the circular bell; but in these mining bells the
action is all enclosed in strong, square teak cases, to protect
the movement, as far as possible, from the effects of
the damp. All the parts are, for the same reason, made
very large and strong; the armature is pivoted instead
of being supported on a spring, the hammer shank
being long, and furnished with a heavy bob. The
domes or bells are from 6 inches to 12 inches in diameter,
and are generally fitted with <i>single stroke</i>
movement, so as to enable them to be used for signalling.
The hammer shank, with its bob, and the
dome, which stands in the centre of the case, are the
only parts left uncovered, as may be seen on reference
to Figs. <a href="#FIG_43A">43 <span class="smcap">A</span></a> and <a href="#FIG_43B"><span class="smcap">B</span></a>, where the exterior and interior of
such a bell are shown.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_51" id="SEC_51"></a>§ 51. In the "Electric Trumpet," introduced by
Messrs. Binswanger, of the General Electric Company,
we have a very novel and effective arrangement of<!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the parts of an electric bell and telephone together.
This instrument, along with its battery, line and push,
is illustrated at <a href="#FIG_44">Fig. 44</a>, where <span class="smcap">A</span> is a hollow brass
cylinder, in which is placed an ordinary electro-magnet
similar to <a href="#FIG_20">Figs. 20</a> or <a href="#FIG_20A">20 <span class="smcap">A</span></a>. At the front end, near <span class="smcap">B</span>, is
affixed by its edges a thin disc of sheet iron, precisely
as in the Bell telephone,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and over against it, at <span class="smcap">B</span>, is an
insulated contact screw, as in the ordinary trembling
bell. On the disc of sheet iron, at the spot where the
screw touches, is soldered a speck of platinum. The
wires from the electro-magnet are connected, one to the
upper binding screw, the other to the brass case of the
instrument itself, which is in metallic communication<!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
with the sheet iron disc. The return wire from the contact
screw is shown attached to the insulated piece, and
is fastened to another binding screw (not visible) on the
base board. When contact is made with the battery,
through the press or push, the magnet becomes energised,
and pulls the iron disc or diaphragm towards it,
causing it to buckle inwards. In doing this, contact is
broken with the screw <span class="smcap">B</span>; consequently the diaphragm
again straightens out, as the magnet no longer pulls it.
Again contact is made; when of course the same round
of performances is continuously repeated. As the plate
or diaphragm vibrates many hundreds of times per
second, it sets up a distinctly musical and loud sound
wave, not unlike the note of a cornet-a-piston, or a loud
harmonium reed. With a number of these "trumpets,"
each diaphragm being duly tuned to its proper pitch, it
would be possible to construct a novel musical instrument,
working solely by electricity. The "pushes"
need only take the form of pianoforte keys to render
the instrument within the grasp of any pianoforte or
organ player.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_52" id="SEC_52"></a>§ 52. Sometimes the gong or "dome" of the ordinary
bell is replaced by a coil spring, as in the American
clocks; sometimes quaint forms are given to the parts
covering the "movement," so as to imitate the head of
an owl, etc. But bells with these changes in outward
form will not present any difficulty, either in fixing or in
management, to those who have mastered the structural
and working details given in this chapter.</p>

ON CONTACTS, PUSHES, SWITCHES, KEYS, ALARMS,
AND RELAYS.</h2>


<p><a name="SEC_53" id="SEC_53"></a>§ 53. All the appliances which have hitherto been
described, would be utterly useless for the purposes intended,
had we not at hand some means of easily,
certainly and rapidly completing and breaking the
circuit between the bell or bells, on the one hand, and
the battery on the other. This necessary piece of
apparatus, which is simply a contact maker, receives
different names, dependent on its application. When it
is intended to be actuated directly by hand, it is known
as a "push," a "pressel," or "pull," according to the
mode in which the contact is made. At <a href="#FIG_45">Fig. 45</a>, <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span>,
<span class="smcap">D</span>, and <span class="smcap">E</span>, show the outward forms of various "pushes,"
in wood and china, as sent out by the leading makers.
(The ones figured are from Messrs. Binswanger &amp; Co.)
At <span class="smcap">F</span> is a sectional view of one of these pushes, and <span class="smcap">G</span>
shows the interior when the cover has been removed.
From these two latter illustrations it will be easily understood
that the "push" consists essentially in two pieces of<!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
metal one or both of which are springs, and one of which
is connected with one of the wires from the battery,
while the other is attached to the wire proceeding to the
bell. When the button is pressed the upper spring
comes into contact with the lower metal spring or plate.
The circuit is now complete; hence the bell rings. But
as soon as the finger is removed from the stud or button
of the "push," the spring returns to its old place, contact
being thereby broken when the bell ceases to ring,
unless it be fitted with a continuous ringing arrangement
(see <a href="#SEC_48">§ 48</a>). In fastening the leading wires to these<!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
pushes, care must be taken that the ends of the wires be
scraped, and sand papered quite clean and bright, bent
into a loop which must be inserted under the head of the
screw that holds the wire to the spring pieces; the
screws being then tightened up carefully to ensure
a good grip and contact with the wires.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_54" id="SEC_54"></a>§ 54. A "pressel" (<a href="#FIG_46">Fig. 46</a>) is simply a push which
instead of being made a fixture by being fastened in the
wall or door, is attached to a
metallic wired line, so that it is
generally made to resemble somewhat
in outward appearance the
knob or tassel of the bell-pull of the
last generation, the interior arrangement
is precisely similar to that of
the push; that is to say, the pressel
consists in a pear-shaped or acorn-shaped
hollow wooden box, with a
projecting knob or button below.
This button is attached to a spring,
the tension of which keeps the
knob protruding from the end of the box, and at the
same time prevents contacts with the second spring at
the bottom of the box. Two insulated wires, one from
the battery, the other from the bell, are connected to
separate screws at the top of the pressel. One of these
screws connects with the lower spring, the other with
the upper.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_55" id="SEC_55"></a>§ 55. The "pull" (<a href="#FIG_47">Fig. 47</a>), as its name implies,
makes contact and rings the bell on being pulled. The<!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
knob has a rather long shank bar, around which is coiled
a pretty stiff spring. At the farther extremity is an
ebonite or boxwood collar ending in a rather wider
metal ring. The wires from the bell and battery are
connected respectively to two flat springs, <i>a a'</i>, by
the screws <i>b b'</i>. When the knob is pulled, the metal
collar touches both springs, and the circuit is completed.
Closely allied to the "pull" is a form of bedroom contact,
which combines pear-push or pressel and pull in one
device. This will be readily understood on reference
to <a href="#FIG_48">Fig. 48</a>. Another form of bedroom pull, with
ordinary rope and tassel, consists in a box containing a
jointed metal lever, standing over a stud, from which it
is kept out of contact by a counter spring. To the projecting
end of the lever is attached the bell rope. When
this is pulled the lever touches the stud, contact is made,
and the bell rings. This is clearly shown in <a href="#FIG_49A">Fig. 49 <span class="smcap">A</span></a>. In
all these contacts, except the door pull (<a href="#FIG_47">Fig. 47</a>) where
the friction of the action of pulling keeps the surfaces<!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
bright, the points of contact should be tipped with platinum.
Another form of contact to be let in the floor
of the dining-room, within easy reach of the foot of the
carver, or other persons at the head of the table, is
shown at <a href="#FIG_49B">Fig. 49 <span class="smcap">B</span></a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie has introduced a
very ingenious contrivance whereby
the ringer may know whether the bell
at the distant end has rung. This is
effected by inclosing in the push a
device similar to that shown at <a href="#FIG_43A">Fig.
43 <span class="smcap">A</span></a>. That is to say, an electro-magnet
wound with wire, and surmounted
by a thin iron disc, is placed
in circuit with the line wires. The
ringing of the bell rapidly magnetises
and demagnetises the electro-magnet,
and causes a humming sound, which
clearly indicates whether the bell is
ringing or not. As this device can
be made very small, compact, and
not liable to derangement, it is of
easy application.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_56" id="SEC_56"></a>§ 56. The next form of contact
to which our attention must be
directed, is that known as the <i>burglar alarm</i>, with
its variant of door-contacts, sash-contacts, till-contacts,
etc.</p>

<p>The "burglar's pest" (as the contrivance we illustrate
is called) is one of the most useful applications of<!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
electricity for the protection of property against thieves.
It consists usually, first, of a brass plate (<a href="#FIG_50">Fig. 50</a>), upon
which a platinum contact piece is fixed, and second, of
a spring made of hardened brass or steel insulated from
the plate; or of a cylindrical box with a spiral spring
inside (see <a href="#FIG_51">Fig. 51</a>). It is so arranged that as long as
the stud is kept pressed in, the platinum points of contact
are kept apart; this is the position when fixed in
the rebate of a closed door or window; but as soon as
opened, the stud passes outward through the hole, and
the points of contact come together and complete the
circuit of the wires in connection with the bell. The
bell is best to be a continuous ringing one. It may be<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
fixed in the master's bedroom, or outside the premises

<p>Legge's Window Blind contact is an arrangement by
which the blind is secured at the bottom by attaching it
to a hook or button. A slight pressure against the
blind (caused by anyone trying to enter after having
broken a window) sets the electric bell in motion
unknown to the intruder.</p>

<p>A form of floor contact, which may be placed under a
light mat or carpet, illustrated at <a href="#FIG_52">Fig. 52</a>, serves to
give notice if anyone be waiting at the door, or stepping
into places which are desired to be kept private. All these
arrangements, to be serviceable, should be connected
with continuous ringing bells (see <a href="#SEC_48">§ 48</a>). Wherever it
is likely that these arrangements may stand a long time<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
without being called into play, it is better to employ
some form of contact in which a <i>rubbing</i> action (which
tends to clean the surfaces and then make a good contact)
is brought into play, rather than a merely <i>dotting</i>
action. For this reason, spring contacts in which the
springs connected with the wires are kept apart by an
insulating wedge (shown at <a href="#FIG_53">Fig. 53</a>) as long as the
door or window are kept closed, are preferred. In the
case of windows, strips of brass let into the frame on
each side of the sash, are thrown into contact by the
springs <i>a</i> and <i>a'</i> in the sash itself, as shown at <a href="#FIG_54">Fig. 54</a>.
For shop doors and others, where a short contact only
is required, and this only when the door is opened, a
contact such as shown at <a href="#FIG_55">Fig. 55</a> is well adapted. It
consists, as will be seen, in a peculiarly shaped pivoted
trigger <i>a</i>, which is lifted forwards when the door is
opened, so that it makes contact with the spring <i>b</i>.
Owing to the curved shape of the arm of the<!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
trigger, the contact is not repeated when the door is
closed.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_57" id="SEC_57"></a>§ 57. In all forms of burglar or thief alarms, the
ordinary system of having the circuit broken, until contact
is made by the intruder involuntarily making contact
at some point, presents one great disadvantage; and
that is, that if "<i>notre ami l'ennemi</i>," viz., the thief or
burglar, be anything of an electrician (and alas! to what
base uses may not even science be perverted) he will
begin by cutting all suspicious-looking wires before he<!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
attempts to set about any serious work. This disadvantage
may be entirely overcome by the adoption of a
simple modification, known as the "closed circuit
system" of bell ringing. For this the bells, etc., are
continuously in contact with the batteries, but owing
to the peculiar connections, do not ring unless the
circuit is broken. To render the working of such a
system clear to my readers, I quote the description
given in the <i>English Mechanic</i>, by one of our leading
electricians:&mdash;</p>

<p>Writing on the subject of Closed Circuit Bell-ringing,
Mr. Perren Maycock says:&mdash;"This is principally adopted
for alarm purposes. Its superiority over the open circuit
system lies in the fact that notice is given on opening
(breaking) the circuit, which is the reverse to the
usual practice. In the ordinary method it becomes
necessary to have a contact maker, differing in form for
various purposes and situations, which, along with the
leading wires, must be artfully concealed. All this
entails great expense; besides which one can never be
sure that the contacts and wires are in proper order
without actually trying each one. On the other hand,
with the "closed circuit" system, one has merely to
place the wire in any convenient position, it being better
<i>seen</i> than <i>hidden</i>. The very fact that alarm is given on
breaking the contact renders the method applicable in
circumstances and under conditions which would render
the "open" method difficult and expensive, if not impossible.
One can always be certain that everything is
in order. The modern burglar, electrically educated<!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
as regards common practise in such matters, would
naturally make a point of cutting all wires that fall
in his path. From these and other obvious considerations,
it is evident how simple and yet how perfect
a means of protection such a system provides. I
will now proceed to explain the manner of application.
The bell used differs from the ordinary, only in the
arrangement of its external connections.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_56A">Fig. 56 <span class="smcap">A</span></a> represents a single-alarm circuit. When
contact is broken externally, there is a closed circuit
in which are the battery and bell magnet coils.<!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Consequently the armature is drawn away from the
contact stud, close up to the electro-magnet, and is
held so. When a break occurs, the armature flies back,
completes the local circuit, and rings so long as the
external circuit remains broken. There is a switch for
use when the alarm is not required.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_56B">Fig. 56 <span class="smcap">B</span></a> represents a case in which notice is given at
two places. By insulating a key as shown, reply signalling
can be carried on between the points at which the
bells are placed. A special gravity Daniell modification
(<a href="#SEC_25">§ 25</a>) is used for this class of work (<a href="#FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>): a narrow
lead cylinder, about 2" in diameter, watertight except
at the bottom, where it opens out into an inverted cone,
the surface of which is pierced with holes. This stands
immersed in dilute sulphuric acid. A saturated solution
of copper sulphate is next carefully introduced, so as to
displace the acid upwards. Crystals of sulphate of<!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
copper are introduced into the open end at the top of
cylinder, to fill the perforated portion at the bottom.
From the wooden cover of cell a thick flat ring of amalgamated
zinc hangs suspended in the dilute acid. Care
should be taken not to introduce the zinc till the two
solutions have become well separated. During action
this becomes coppered, while in contact with the sulphate
of copper, but it is not attacked by the acid. It is,
however, preferable to <i>paint</i> that portion of the lead,
which is surrounded by the acid. The height of the
cell is about 14."</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that if this latter system
be employed, special contacts,
which break contact when the
pressure is removed, must be
employed for the door or window
contacts. A simple form is shown
at <a href="#FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>.</p>

<p>Contacts similar to Figs. <a href="#FIG_50">50</a>, <a href="#FIG_53">53</a> and <a href="#FIG_54">54</a>, may be fitted
on tills or drawers.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="SEC_58" id="SEC_58"></a>§ 58. Another useful application of "contact" is for
the notification of any rise or fall of temperature beyond
certain fixed limits. The devices used for this purpose
are known as "fire alarms," "frost alarms," and "thermometer
alarms." The thermometer alarm is at once
the most effective and trustworthy of the forms known,
as, besides its delicacy, it has the advantage of being able
to give notice of low, as well as of abnormally high temperature.
The form usually given to the electric alarm
thermometer, is well shown at <a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>. It consists in an<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
ordinary thermometer with a wire projecting into the tube
to a certain point, say 100 degrees. The mercury in
the bulb being also connected with another wire. When
the temperature is within the usual
climatic range, the mercury does not
reach the upper wire. If by reason of
fire or any other abnormal heat, the
temperature rises beyond that to which
the instrument is set, the mercury rises
and touches the upper wire, contact
is thus established, and the bell rings.</p>

<p>By giving the thermometer the shape
of a letter U, it is possible to notify also
a fall below a certain degree, as well as
a rise beyond a certain fixed point.
These thermometers are specially used
by nurserymen and others, to warn
them of the too great lowering of
temperature, or <i>vice versâ</i>, in the
houses under their charge.</p>

<p>Other forms of fire alarms are shown
at Fig. <a href="#FIG_60">60</a> and <a href="#FIG_61">61</a>. If a strip be built
up of two thin layers of dissimilar
metals riveted together, as the two
metals do not expand at the same
rate, the strip will bend to the <i>right</i>
if heated, and to the <i>left</i> if cooled.
In the instrument shown at <a href="#FIG_60">Fig. 60</a>, the application of
heat causes the flexible strip carrying the contact screw,
to bend over till it touches the lower stop, when, of<!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
course, the bell rings. If two stops are employed instead
of the lower one only, the bell will ring when a low
temperature is reached, which causes the strip to bend
in the opposite direction.</p>

</div>

<p>At <a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a> is illustrated a novel form, in which the
expansion of air causes contact to be made. It consists
in an air chamber hermetically closed by a corrugated
metal plate I, similar to that used in the aneroid barometers.
When the temperature rises to a certain point,
the expansion of the air in the chamber brings the<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
metallic plate into contact with the screw, as shown below.
This closes the circuit and rings the bell in the usual
manner. In all these fire or thermometer alarms, the
exact degree of heat at which the bell shall ring, can be
pretty accurately adjusted by means of the contact
screws.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_59" id="SEC_59"></a>§ 59. Closely allied to these forms of contacts are
the devices whereby an ordinary clock or watch can be
made to arouse the over-drowsy sleeper by the ringing
of an electric bell, which in this case should be of the
continuous type. All these depend in their action upon
some arrangement whereby when the hour hand of the
clock or watch arrives at a certain given point in its
travel, it makes contact between the battery and bell.
In general the contact piece is attached bodily to the
clock, but in the very ingenious arrangement illustrated
at <a href="#FIG_62">Fig. 62</a> (devised by Messrs. Binswanger) the contacts
are attached to an outer case, and as the case of the
watch itself forms one point of contact, any watch that
will slip in the case, may be set to ring the bell.</p>

<p>Messrs. Gent, of Leicester, have also perfected an
electric watchman's clock, which records the number of
places the watchman in charge has visited or missed on
his rounds. This we illustrate at <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>. We quote
Messrs. Gent's own words, in the following description:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It consists of an eight-day clock, to which is attached
a disc or table revolving upon a vertical axis and driven
by the mechanism of the clock. The disc is covered
with a sheet of paper, attached to it by a binding screw<!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
so that it can be removed when used and a clean sheet
substituted for it. Each sheet of paper is divided longitudinally
into hours and, if necessary, parts of hours, and
crosswise into as many divisions as there are places to
be visited by the watchman&mdash;any number from one to
twenty. Each division has a corresponding marker,
which indicates, by the impression it makes upon the
paper, the time the watchman visits the place connected
with that marker. Wires are carried from the terminals
of the clock, one to the battery, and one to each press-button
fixed at the points intended to be visited by the
watchman; another wire is carried from each press-button
to the other end of the battery. The action is
very simple: when the button is pressed in the current<!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
passes through a coil carrying an armature and contact
breaker with a point at the end of a long arm; a
hammer-like motion is given to the pointer, and a distinct
perforation made in the card. It is usual to have
the press-button in a box locked up, of which the watchman
only has the key.</p>

<p>"The clock may be in the office or bedroom of the<!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
manager or head of the establishment, who can thus,
from time to time, satisfy himself of the watchman's
vigilance. The record should be examined in the morning,
and replaced by a clean sheet of card.</p>

<p>"This clock received the special mention of Her
Majesty's Commissioners in Lunacy, and has been
adopted by some of the largest asylums in the country.</p>

<p>"We have recently made an important improvement by
adding a relay for every marker, thus enabling a local
battery of greater power to be used for actuating the
markers. This has made no alteration in the appearance
of the clock, as the relays are contained within the
cornice at the top of the clock case."</p>


<p><a name="SEC_60" id="SEC_60"></a>§ 60. By means of a float, it is possible to give notice
of the height of water in a tank, a reservoir, or even of
the state of the tide. In these cases all that is needed is
a float with an arm, having a suitable contact attached,
so that when the water rises to the level of the float and
lifts it, it causes the contact piece to complete the circuit
through a set screw. Or the float may be attached to
an arm having a certain play in both directions, <i>i.e.</i>, up
and down, within which no contact is made, as the
arm has a contact piece on either side, which can touch
either an upper or a lower contact screw, according
to whether the tide is low or high, or whether the lock
or tank is nearly empty or too full.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_61" id="SEC_61"></a>§ 61. Sometimes it is convenient to be able to ring
an ordinary trembling bell continuously, as when a
master wishes to wake a member of his family or a
servant; or again, to cut a given bell or bells out of<!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
circuit altogether. The arrangements by which this can
be effected, are known as "switches." Of switches there
are two kinds, namely, <i>plugswitches</i> or <i>interruptors</i>, and
<i>lever switches</i>. The former consists essentially in two
stout plates of brass affixed to a base board of any insulating
material. These brass plates are set parallel to
each other, a short distance apart, and the centre of the
facing edge is hollowed out to take a brass taper plug.
A binding or other screw is fixed to each brass plate, to
connect up to the leading wires.
When the plug is in its socket,
the circuit between the two
plates (and consequently between
the battery and bell, etc.) is
complete; when the plug is out,
the contact is broken. This
form of switch is subject to
work out of order, owing to the
fact that the taper plug
gradually widens the hole, so
that the contact becomes uncertain or defective altogether.
By far the better form of switch is the lever switch, as
shown at <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>. This consists in a movable metal
lever or arm, which is held by a strong spring in contact
with the upper binding screw. It can be made to slide
over to the right or left of the centre, at its lower or free
end, as far as the binding screws or studs shown, which
act at once as stops and point of connection to wires.
When the arm or lever is in the centre no contact is
made but if it be pushed over to the right, it slides on a<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
brass strip let into and lying flush with the base.
Contact is thus made between the upper binding
screw and the left-hand screw. If there is another
brass strip on the left-hand side (as shown in the
figure), contact may be made with another bell,
etc., by sliding the arm to the left; or again, if
no metal strip be placed on the left side the contact
may be broken by pushing the arm towards the left-hand
stud.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_62" id="SEC_62"></a>§ 62. A <i>key</i> is another form of contact, by means of
which a long or short completion of circuit can be made
by simply tapping on the knob. It is particularly useful
when it is desired to transmit signals, either by
ringing or otherwise. It consists, as may be seen at
<a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>, of a lever or arm of brass, pivoted at its centre,
furnished with a spring which keeps the portion under
the knob out of contact with the stud in the front of
the base-board. As both the stud and the lever are
connected to binding screws communicating with the
battery and bell, etc., it is evident that on depressing
the key the circuit with the bell will be completed for a
longer or shorter period, varying with the duration of
the depression. Hence, either by using preconcerted
signals of short and long rings to signify certain common
words, such as a long ring for <i>No</i>, and a short one for
<i>Yes</i>, or by an adaptation of the ordinary Morse code,
intelligible conversation can be kept up between house
and stable, etc., etc., by means of a key and a bell. As
Mr. Edwinson has given much time to the elucidation
of this system of bell signalling, I cannot do better<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
than quote his instructions, as given in <i>Amateur
Work</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For this purpose preconcerted signals have been
agreed upon or invented as required, and these have
been found to be irksome and difficult to remember,
because constructed without any reference to a
definite plan. We may, however, reduce bell signals
to a definite system, and use this system or code as
a means to carry on conversation at a distance as
intelligently as it can be done by a pair of telegraph
instruments. In fact, the Morse telegraph code can be
easily adopted for use with electric bells of the vibrating
or trembling type, and its alphabet, as appended
below, easily learnt. The letters of the alphabet are
represented by long strokes and short strokes on the
bell, as here shown.&mdash;</p>

<p>"In sending signals to indicate stops, no regard must
be had to the letters which they represent; these are only
given as aids to memory, and are not to be represented
separately on the bell. Bell signals must be given with a
certain amount of regularity as to time; indeed, to
carry on a conversation in this way it is necessary to be
as punctilious in time as when playing a piece of music
on a piano, if the signals are to be understood. The dots of
the signal should therefore be represented in time by
<i>one</i>, and the dashes by <i>two</i>, whilst the spaces between
words and figures where a stop does not intervene should
be represented by a pause equal to that taken by a person
counting <i>three</i>, the space between a word and a stop
being of the same duration. To make this more clear<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

<p><a name="SEC_63" id="SEC_63"></a>§ 63. At <a href="#SEC_48">§ 48</a>, we
noticed that a device
known as a <i>Relay</i> is a
convenient, if not an
essential mode of working
continuous ringing
bells. Here we will
direct our attention to
its structural arrangement,
and to its adaptations. Let us suppose that we had
to ring a bell at a considerable distance, so far indeed that
a single battery would not energise the electro-magnets
of an ordinary bell, sufficiently to produce a distinct
ring. It is evident that if we could signal, ever so
feebly, to an attendant at the other end of the line to
make contact with another battery at the distant end
of the line to <i>his</i> bell, by means, say, of a key similar
to that shown at <a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>, we should get a clear ring,
since this second battery, being close to the bell, would
send plenty of current to energise the bell's magnets.<!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
But this would require a person constantly in attendance.
Now the <i>relay</i> does this automatically; it <i>relays</i>
another battery in the circuit. The manner in which
it effects this will be rendered clear, on examination of
<a href="#FIG_66">Fig. 66</a>. Here we have an armature <span class="smcap">A</span> attached to a
light spring, which can play between an insulated stop
<span class="smcap">C</span>, and a contact screw <span class="smcap">B</span>. The play of this armature
can be regulated to a nicety by turning the screws
<span class="smcap">B</span> or <span class="smcap">C</span>. These two screws are both borne by a double
bent arm (of metal) affixed
to the pillar <span class="smcap">D</span>. This pillar
is separated from the rest of
the frame by an insulating
collar or washer of ebonite,
so that no current can
pass from <span class="smcap">E</span> to <span class="smcap">D</span>, unless the
armature be pulled down
so as to make contact with
the contact screw <span class="smcap">B</span>. Just
under the armature, stands
the electro-magnet <span class="smcap">G</span>, which when energised can and does
pull down the armature <span class="smcap">A</span>. It will be readily understood
that if we connect the wires from the electro-magnet <span class="smcap">G</span>,
to the wires proceeding from the battery and push (or
other form of contact) at the distant station, the electro-magnet,
being wound with a large quantity of fine
wire, will become sufficiently magnetized to pull the
armature down through the small space intervening
between <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>; so that if the screws <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span> are
connected respectively to the free terminals of a<!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
battery and bell coupled together at the nearer station,
this second battery will be thrown into circuit with the
bell, and cause it to ring as well and as exactly as if the
most skilful and most trustworthy assistant were in
communication with the distant signaller. Every tap,
every release of the contact, (be it push, key, or switch)
made at the distant end, will be faithfully reproduced at
the nearer end, by the motion of the armature A. For
this reason we may use a comparatively weak battery to
work the relay, which in its turn brings a more powerful
and <i>local</i> battery into play, for doing whatever
work is required. In cases where a number of calls
are required to be made simultaneously from one
centre, as in the case of calling assistance from several
fire engine stations at once, a relay is fixed at each
station, each connected with its own local battery and
bell. The current from the sending station passes
direct through all the relays, connecting all the local
batteries and bells at the same time. This is perhaps
the best way of ringing any number of bells from one
push or contact, at a distant point. Ordinary trembling
bells, unless fitted with an appropriate contrivance,
cannot well be rung if connected up in <i>series</i>. This is
owing to the fact that the clappers of the bells do not
all break or make contact at the same time, so that
intermittent ringing and interruptions take place. With
single stroke bells, this is not the case, as the pulling
down of the armature does not break the contact.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_64" id="SEC_64"></a>§ 64. We now have to consider those contrivances
by means of which it is possible for an attendant to<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
know when a single bell is actuated by a number of
pushes in different rooms, etc., from whence the signal
emanates. These contrivances are known as <i>indicators</i>.
Indicators may be conveniently divided into 3 classes,
viz.:&mdash;1st, indicators with <i>mechanical</i> replacements;
2nd, those with electrical replacements; and 3rdly, those
which are self replacing. Of the former class we may
mention two typical forms, namely, the ordinary "fall
back" indicator, and the drop indicator. All indicators
depend in their action on the sudden magnetisation of an
electro-magnet by the same current that works the
electric bell at the time the call is sent. To understand
the way in which this may be effected, let the
reader turn to the illustration of the Relay (<a href="#FIG_66">Fig. 66</a>),
and let him suppose that the pillar <span class="smcap">D</span>, with its accompanying
rectangle <span class="smcap">B C</span>, were removed, leaving only
the electro-magnet <span class="smcap">G</span>, with its frame and armature <span class="smcap">A</span>.
If this armature holds up a light tablet or card, on which
is marked the number of the room, it is evident that
any downward motion of the armature, such as would
occur if the electro-magnet were energised by a current
passing around it, would let the tablet fall, so as to
become visible through a hole cut in the frame containing
this contrivance. It is also equally evident
that the card or tablet would require replacing by hand,
after having once fallen, to render it capable of again
notifying a call. <a href="#FIG_67">Fig. 67</a> shows the working parts of
one of these "drop" indicators, as sent out by Messrs.
Binswanger. In another modification, known as
Thorpe's "Semaphore Indicator," we have a most<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
ingenious application of the same principle in a very
compact form. In this (<a href="#FIG_68">Fig. 68</a>), the electro-magnet
is placed directly behind a disc-shaped iron armature, on
which is painted or marked the number of the room
etc. (in this case 4); this armature is attached by a springy
shank to the drop bar, shown to the left of the electro-magnet.
In front of the armature is a light metal
disc, also pivoted on the drop bar. This engages in a
catch above, when pushed up so as to cover the
number. When pushed up, the
spring of the armature retains
it in its place so that the
number is hidden. When the
current passes around the
electro-magnet, the armature is
pulled toward it, and thus frees
the covering disc, which therefore
falls, and displays the
number. The ordinary form
of "fall back" indicator (a
misnomer, by the way, since the indicator falls forwards)
is well illustrated at <a href="#FIG_69">Fig 69</a>. Here we have an
ordinary electro-magnet <span class="smcap">A</span>, with its wires <i>w</i> <i>w'</i> standing
over an armature <span class="smcap">B</span> attached to a spring <span class="smcap">C</span>, which bears
on its lower extremity, a toothed projection which
serves to hold up the short arm of the bent lever <span class="smcap">D</span>,
which supports the number plate <span class="smcap">E</span>. When the electro-magnet
<span class="smcap">A</span> is energised by the current, it pulls up the
armature <span class="smcap">B</span>, which releases the detent <span class="smcap">D</span> from the
tooth <span class="smcap">C</span>; the number plate therefore falls forwards, as<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
shown by the dotted lines, and shows itself at the
aperture <span class="smcap">E´</span>, which is in front of the indicator frame.
To replace the number out of sight, the attendant
pushes back the plate <span class="smcap">E</span>, till it again engages the
bent lever <span class="smcap">D</span> in the tooth <span class="smcap">C</span>. This replacement of the
number plate, which the attendant in charge is obliged
to perform, gives
rise to confusion,
if through carelessness
it is not effected
at once, as two or
more numbers may
be left showing at
one time. For this
reason, indicators
which require no
extraneous assistance
to replace
them, are preferred
by many. Indicators
with electrical
replacements meet
in part the necessities
of the case. This form of indicator consists usually
of a permanent bar magnet pivoted near its centre,
so that it can hang vertically between the two poles
of an electro-magnet placed at its lower extremity.
The upper extremity carries the number plate, which
shows through the aperture in the frame. This bar
magnet is made a trifle heavier at the upper end, so<!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that it must rest against either the one or other pole
of the electro-magnet below. If the <i>north</i> pole of the
bar magnet rests against the <i>right</i> hand pole of the
electro-magnet when the number does not show, we
can cause the bar magnet to cross over to the other
pole, and display the number by sending a current
through the electro-magnet in such a direction as to
make its right hand pole a north pole, and its left
hand a south pole. This
is because the two north
poles will repel each other,
while the south will attract
the north. On being once
tilted over, the bar magnet
cannot return to its former
position, until the person
who used the bell sends a
current in the opposite
direction (which he can do
by means of a reversing
switch), when the poles of
the electro-magnet being
reversed, the bar magnet will be pulled back into
its original position. Indicators of this class, owing
to the fact that their replacement depends on the
<i>polarity</i> of the bar magnet, are also known as "polarised
indicators."</p>

<p><a name="SEC_65" id="SEC_65"></a>§ 65. For general efficiency and trustworthiness, the
<i>pendulum indicator</i>; as shown at <a href="#FIG_70">Fig. 70</a>, is unsurpassed.
It consists of an electro-magnet with prolongation<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
at the free end on which is delicately pivoted a soft
iron armature. From the centre of this armature
hangs, pendulum fashion, a light brass rod carrying
a vane of fluted silver glass, or a card with a number on
it, as may be found most convenient. This vane or card
hangs just before the aperture in the indicator frame.
Stops are usually placed on each side of the pendulum
rod to limit the swing. When the electro-magnet is
magnetised by the passage of the current, the armature
is pulled suddenly on one side, and
then the pendulum swings backwards
and forwards in front of the aperture
for some minutes before it comes to
rest. When fitted with silver fluted
glass, the motion of the vane is clearly
visible even in badly lighted places.
As the pendulum, after performing
several oscillations, comes to rest by
itself in front of the aperture, this
indicator requires no setting. Messrs.
Binswanger fit these indicators with double core
magnets, and have a patented adjustment for regulating
the duration of the swings of the pendulum, which
may be made to swing for two or three minutes when
the circuit is completed by pressing the push; it then
returns to its normal position, thus saving the servant
the trouble of replacing the "drop."</p>

<p>Messrs. Gent, of Leicester, have also patented a device
in connection with this form of indicator, which we
give in the patentee's own words:&mdash;"The objection so<!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
frequently urged against the use of Electric Bells, that
the servants cannot be depended upon to perform the
operation of replacing the signals, cannot any longer
apply, for the pendulum signals require no attention
whatever. It consists of an electro-magnet having forks
standing up in which V openings are made. An armature
of soft iron, with a piece of thin steel projecting
at each end lies suspended at the bottom of the V
opening, a brass stem carrying the signal card is
screwed into the armature, the action being, that when
a current is allowed to pass through the electro-magnet
the armature with the pendulum is drawn towards it
and held there until the current ceases to pass, when it
instantly looses its hold of the armature, which swings
away and continues to oscillate for two or three minutes,
so that if the servant happens to be out of the way, it
may be seen on her return which pendulum has been
set in motion. The Pendulum Indicator we have
recently patented is entirely self-contained. The magnet
has its projecting poles riveted into the brass base which
carries the flag. The flag is constructed as <a href="#FIG_70">Fig. 70</a>, but
swings in closed bearings, which prevents its jerking out
of its place, and enables us to send it out in position
ready for use. It will be seen this <i>patented</i> improvement
makes all screws and plates as formerly used for securing
the parts unnecessary. It will be seen at once that this
is simplicity itself, and has nothing about it which may
by any possibility be put out of order, either by warping
or shrinking of the case or carelessness of attendants."</p>

<p>There is only one point that needs further notice<!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with regard to these pendulum indicators, and that is,
that since the rapid break and make contact of the
ringing bell interferes somewhat with the proper action
of the indicator magnet, it is always advisable to work
the indicator by means of a relay (fixed in the same
frame) and a <i>local</i> battery. This is shown in <a href="#FIG_71">Fig. 71</a>,
where a second pair of wires attached to <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>, to the
extreme right of the indicator frame, are brought from
the same battery to work the indicator and contained
relay. It is not advisable, however, with the pendulum
indicator, to use the same battery for the indicator; the
relay should throw a local battery into the indicator
circuit. In <a href="#FIG_71">Fig. 71</a> six pushes are shown to the left of
the indicator frame. These, of course, are supposed to
be in as many different rooms.<!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>We close this chapter with an engraving of a very
compact and neat form of drop indicator devised by
Messrs. Gent, and called by them a "Tripolar Indicator."
It consists, as the name implies, of a single magnet,
having one end of the iron core as one pole, the other
end extending on each side like a V,
forming, as it were, three poles. Though
but one bobbin is used, the effect is very
powerful. There are no springs or other
complications, so that the arrangement
is adapted for ship use, as are also those
represented at Figs. <a href="#FIG_67">67</a> and <a href="#FIG_68">68</a>. Pendulum
and fall-back indicators, as well as polarised
indicators, owing to the delicacy of the adjustments, are
unfitted for use on board ship, or in the cabs of lifts,
where the sudden jolts and jerks are sure to move the
indicators, and falsify the indications. The tripolar
indicator is illustrated at <a href="#FIG_72">Fig. 72</a>.</p>

ON WIRING, CONNECTING UP, AND LOCALISING FAULTS.</h2>


<p><a name="SEC_66" id="SEC_66"></a>§ 66. However good may be the bells, indicators,
batteries, etc., used in an electric bell installation, if the
<i>wiring</i> be in any wise faulty, the system will surely be
continually breaking down, and giving rise to dissatisfaction.
It is therefore of the highest importance that
the workman, if he value his good name, should pay the
greatest attention to ensure that this part of his work
be well and thoroughly done. This is all the more
necessary, since while the bells, batteries, relays, pushes,
etc., are easily got at for examination and repair, the
wires, when once laid, are not so easily examined, and
it entails a great deal of trouble to pull up floor boards,
to remove skirtings etc., in order to be able to overhaul
and replace defective wires or joints. The first consideration
of course, is the kind and size of wire fitted
to carry the current for indoor and outdoor work. Now
this must evidently depend on three points. 1st, The
amount of current (in ampères) required to ring the bell.
2nd, The battery power it is intended to employ. 3rd,
The distance to which the lines are to be carried. From<!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
practical experience I have found that it is just possible
to ring a 2&frac12;" bell with &frac12; an ampère of current. Let
us consider what this would allow us to use, in the
way of batteries and wire, to ring such a bell. The
electro-motive force of a single Leclanchè cell is, as we
have seen at <a href="#SEC_38">§ 38</a>, about 1·6 volt, and the internal
resistance of the quart size, about 1·1 ohm. No. 20
gauge copper wire has a resistance of about 1·2 ohm to
the pound, and in a pound (of the cotton covered wire)
there are about 60 yards. Supposing we were to use
60 yards of this wire, we should have a wire resistance
of 1·2 ohm, an internal resistance of 1·1 ohm, and a
bell resistance of about 0·1 of an ohm, altogether
about 2·4 ohms. Since the E.M.F. of the cell is 1·6
volt, we must divide this by the total resistance to
get the amount of current passing. That is to
say:&mdash;</p>



<div class="center">

<tr><td align="center">2·4)</td><td align="center">1·60</td><td align="center">(0·66,</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>or about 2/3 of an ampère; just a little over what
is absolutely necessary to ring the bell. Now this
would allow nothing for the deterioration in the
battery, and the increased resistance in the pushes,
joints, etc. We may safely say, therefore, that no
copper wire, of less diameter than No. 18 gauge (48/1000
of an inch diameter) should be used in wiring up house
bells, except only in very short circuits of two or three
yards, with one single bell in circuit; and as the
difference in price between No. 18 and No. 20 is very<!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
trifling, I should strongly recommend the bell-fitter to
adhere to No. 18, as his smallest standard size. It
would also be well to so proportion the size and arrangement
of the batteries and wires, that, at the time of
setting up, a current of at least one ampère should flow
through the entire circuit. This will allow margin for
the weakening of the battery, which takes place after
it has been for some months in use. As a guide as to
what resistance a given length of copper wire introduces
into any circuit in which it may be employed, I subjoin
the following table of the Birmingham wire gauge,
diameter in 1,000ths of an inch, yards per lb., and
resistance in ohms per lb. or 100 yards, of the wires
which the fitter is likely to be called upon to
employ:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_67" id="SEC_67"></a>§ 67. Whatever gauge wire be selected, it must be
carefully insulated, to avoid all chance contact with nails,
staples, metal pipes or other wires. The best insulation
for wires employed indoors is gutta-percha, surrounded
with a coating of cotton wound over it, except only in
cases when the atmosphere is excessively dry. In these,<!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
as the gutta-percha is apt to crack, india-rubber as the
inner coating is preferable. If No. 18 wire be used,
the thickness of the entire insulating coating should
be thick enough to bring it up to No. 10 gauge, say
a little over 1/10th inch in diameter. There is one point
that will be found very important in practice, and that
is to have the cotton covering on the wires <i>leading</i> to
the bells of a different colour from that on the <i>return</i>
wires; in other words, the wires starting from the zinc
poles of the battery to the bells, indicators, relays, etc.,
should be of a different colour from that leading from
the carbon poles to the bells, etc. Attention to this
apparently trifling matter, will save an infinite amount
of trouble in connecting up, repairing, or adding on fresh
branch circuits. For outdoor work, wire of the same
gauge (No. 18) may generally be used, but it must be
covered to the thickness of 1/10" with pure gutta-percha,
and over this must be wound tape served with Stockholm
tar. Wires of this description, either with or
without the tarred tape covering, may be obtained from
all the leading electricians' sundriesmen. Many firms
use copper wire <i>tinned</i> previous to being insulated. This
tinning serves two good purposes, 1st, the copper wire
does not verdigris so easily; 2ndly, it is more easily
soldered. On the other hand, a tinned wire is always a
little harder, and presents a little higher resistance.
Whenever wires are to be joined together, the ends to
be joined must be carefully divested of their covering
for a length of about three inches, the copper carefully
cleaned by scraping and sand-papering, twisted tightly<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and evenly together, as shown in <a href="#FIG_73">Fig. 73 A</a>, and soldered
with ordinary soft solder (without spirits), and a little
resin or composite candle as a flux. A heavy plumber's
soldering iron, or even a tinman's bit, is not well adapted
for this purpose, and the blowpipe is even worse, as the
great heat melts and spoils the gutta-percha covering.
The best form of bit, is one made out of a stout piece
of round copper wire &frac14;" thick with a nick filed in its
upper surface for the wire to lie in (see <a href="#FIG_73">Fig. 73 <span class="smcap">B</span></a>). This
may be fastened into a wooden handle, and when required
heated over the flame of a spirit lamp. When the soldering
has been neatly effected, the waste ends <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of the
wire should be cut off flush. The wire must then be carefully
covered with warm Prout's elastic or softened gutta-percha,
heated and kneaded round the wire with the
fingers (moistened so as not to stick) until the joint is of
the same size as the rest of the covered wire. As a
further precaution, the joints should be wrapped with
a layer of tarred tape. Let me strongly dissuade<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the fitter from ever being contented with a simply
twisted joint. Although this may and does act
while the surfaces are still clean, yet the copper soon
oxidises, and a poor non-conducting joint is the final
result.</p>

<p>"That'll do" will not do for electric bell-fitting.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_68" id="SEC_68"></a>§ 68. Whenever possible, the wiring of a house, etc.,
for bell work, should be done as soon as the walls are
up and the roof is on. The shortest and straightest convenient
route from bell to battery, etc., should always
be chosen where practicable to facilitate drawing the
wire through and to avoid the loss of current which
the resistance of long lengths of wire inevitably entails.
The wires should be run in light zinc tubes nailed to
the wall.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 74.</p>
</div>


<p>In joining up several lengths of tubing, the end of
one piece of tube should be opened out <i>considerably</i> of
a trumpet shape for the other piece to slip in; and the
end of this latter should also be <i>slightly</i> opened out,
so as not to catch in the covering of any wire drawn
through it. The greatest care must be exercised in
drawing the wires through the tubes or otherwise, that
the covering be not abraded, or else leakage at this point
may take place. In cases where tubes already exist, as
in replacing old crank bells by the electric bells, the
new wires can be drawn through the tubes, by tying
the ends of the new wire to the old wire, and carefully
pulling this out, when it brings the new wire with it.
Or if the tubes are already empty, some straight stout
wire may be run through the tubes, to which the new<!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
wires may be attached, and then drawn through, using,
of course, every possible precaution to avoid the abrasion
of the insulating covering of the wire, which would
surely entail leakage and loss of current. All the old
fittings, cranks, levers, etc., must be removed, and the
holes left, carefully filled with dowels or plaster. In
those cases where it is quite impossible to lay the wires
in zinc or wooden tubes (as in putting up wires in furnished
rooms already papered, etc.), the wires may be
run along the walls, and suspended by staples driven in
the least noticeable places; but in no case should the two
wires (go and return) lie under the same staple, for fear
of a short circuit. It must be borne in mind that each
complete circuit will require at least two wires, viz.,
the one leading from the battery to the bell, and the
other back from the bell to the battery; and these
until connection is made between them by means of
the "contact" (pull, push, or key) must be perfectly
insulated from each other. In these cases, as far as
possible, the wires should be laid in slots cut in the
joists under the floor boards, or, better still, as tending
to weaken the joists less, small holes may be bored in
the joists and the wires passed through them; or
again, the wires may be led along the skirting board,
along the side of the doorpost, etc., and when the sight
of the wires is objectionable, covered with a light ornamental
wood casing. When the wires have been laid and
the position of the "pushes," etc., decided upon, the <i>blocks</i>
to which these are to be fastened must be bedded in
the plaster. These blocks may be either square or circular<!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
pieces of elm, about 3 inches across, and 1 inch thick,
bevelled off smaller above, so as to be easily and firmly
set in the plaster. They may be fastened to the brickwork
by two or three brads, at such a height to lie level
with the finished plaster. There must of course be a
hole in the centre of the block, through which the wires
can pass to the push. When the block has been fixed
in place, the zinc tube, if it does not come quite up to
the block, should have its orifice stopped
with a little paper, to prevent any
plaster, etc., getting into the tube. A
little care in setting the block will avoid
the necessity of this makeshift. A long
nail or screw driven into the block will
serve to mark its place, and save time
in hunting for it after the plastering has
been done. When the blocks have been
put in their places, and the plastering,
papering, etc., done, the wires are drawn through the
bottom hole of the push (after the lid or cover has been
taken off), <a href="#FIG_74">Fig. 74</a>, and a very small piece of the covering
of the wire having been removed from each wire, and
brightened by sand papering, one piece is passed round
the shank of the screw connected with the lower spring,
shown to the <i>right</i> in <a href="#FIG_74">Fig. 74</a>, and the other round the
shank of the screw connected to the upper spring, shown
to the <i>left</i> in the Fig. The screws must be loosened to
enable the operator to pass the wire under their heads.
The screws must then be tightened up to clench the wire
quite firmly. In doing this, we must guard against three<!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
things. Firstly, in pulling the wire through the block,
not to pull so tightly as to cut the covering against the
edge of the zinc tube. Secondly, not to uncover too
much of the wire, so as to make contact between the
wires themselves either at the back of the push, or
at any other part of the push itself. Thirdly, to
secure good contact under the screws, by having the
ends of the wires quite clean, and tightly screwed
down.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_69" id="SEC_69"></a>§ 69. In all cases where the wires have to be taken
out of doors, such as is necessitated by communication
from house to outhouses, stables, greenhouses, etc., over
head lines (No. 18 gauge, gutta-percha tape and tar
covering) should be used. Where overhead lines are
not admissible, either as being eyesores, or otherwise,
the wires may be laid in square wooden casings of this
section <span title="box section with opening to above">&#9495;&#9473;&#9499;</span>, the open part of which must be covered by a
strip of wood laid over it. The wood must have been
previously creosoted, in the same manner as railway
sleepers. This mode admits of easy examination. Iron
pipes must, however, be used if the lines have to pass
under roads, etc., where there is any heavy traffic. And
it must be borne in mind that however carefully the iron
pipes, etc., be cemented at the joints, to make them
watertight, there will always be more electrical leakage
in underground lines than in overhead ones. In certain
rare cases it may be needful to use <i>iron</i> wires for this
purpose instead of copper; in this case, as iron is six or
seven times a worse conductor than copper, a much heavier
wire must be employed to get the same effect. In other<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
words, where iron wire is used, its section must be not
less than seven times that of the copper wire which it
replaces.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_70" id="SEC_70"></a>§ 70. It is always preferable, where great distance
(and, consequently, greater expense) do not preclude it,
to use wire for the leading as well as for the returning
circuit. Still, where for any reason this is not practicable,
it is perfectly admissible and possible to make a
good return circuit through the <i>earth</i>, that is to make
the damp soil carry the return current (see <a href="#SEC_37">§ 37</a>). As
recommended at the section just quoted, this earth circuit
must have at each extremity a mass of some good
conductor plunged into the moist ground. In <i>towns</i>,
where there are plenty of water mains and gas mains, this
is a matter of no difficulty, the only point being to
ensure <i>good</i> contact with these masses of metal. In
other places a hole must be dug into the ground until
the point of constant moisture is reached; in this must
be placed a sheet of lead or copper, not less than five
square feet surface, to which the <i>earth</i> wires are soldered,
the hole then filled in with ordinary coke, well rammed
down to within about six inches of the surface, and then
covered up with soil well trodden down. In making
contact with water or gas pipes, care must be taken to
see that these are <i>main</i> pipes, so that they <i>do</i> lead to
earth, and not to a cistern or meter only, as, if there are
any white or red lead joints the circuit will be defective.
To secure a good contact with an iron pipe, bare it, file
its surface clean, rub it over with a bit of blue stone
(sulphate of copper) dipped in water; wipe it quite<!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
dry, bind it tightly and evenly round with some bare
copper wire (also well cleaned), No. 16 gauge. Bring
the two ends of the wire together, and twist them up
tightly for a length of three or four inches. Now heat a
large soldering bit, put some resin on the copper wire,
and solder the wire, binding firmly down to the iron
pipe. Do likewise to the projecting twist of wire, and
to this twist solder the end of the <i>return</i> wire. On no
account should the two opposite <i>earth</i> wires be soldered
to water mains and gas mains at the same time, since it
has been found that the different conditions in which
these pipes find themselves is sufficient to set up a current
which might seriously interfere with the working
of the battery proper. Sometimes there is no means of
getting a good <i>earth</i> except through the gas main: in
this case we must be careful to get to the street side of
the meter, for the red lead joints will prevent good conductivity
being obtained. In out of the way country
places, if it is possible to get at the metal pipe leading
to the well of a pump, a very good "earth" can be obtained
by soldering the wires to that pipe, in the same
manner as directed in the case of the water main. The
operator should in no case be contented with a merely
twisted joint, for the mere contact of the two metals
(copper and iron) sets up in the moist earth or air a
little electric circuit of its own, and this speedily rusts
through and destroys the wires. The following suggestions,
by Messrs. Gent, on the subject of wiring, are so
good, that we feel that we shall be doing real service to
the reader to quote them here in full:<!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"1st.&mdash;The description of wire to be used. It is of
the utmost importance that all wires used for electric
bell purposes be of pure copper and thoroughly well
insulated. The materials mostly employed for insulating
purposes are indiarubber, gutta-percha, or cotton
saturated with paraffin. For ordinary indoor work, in
dry places, and for connecting doors and windows with
burglar alarms, or for signalling in case of fire, indiarubber
and cotton covered wires answer well; but for
connecting long distances, part or all underground, or
along walls, or in damp cellars or buildings, gutta-percha
covered wire is required, but it should be fixed
where it will not be exposed to heat or the sun, or in
very dry places, as the covering so exposed will perish,
crack, and in time fall off. This may be, to some extent,
prevented by its being covered with cotton; but
we recommend for warm or exposed positions a specially-prepared
wire, in which rubber and compound form
the insulating materials, the outside being braided or
taped.</p>

<p>"For ordinary house work, we refer to lay a wire of
No. 18 or 20 copper, covered to No. 14 or 11 with gutta-percha,
and an outer covering of cotton, which we called
the 'battery' wire, this being the wire which conveys
the current from the battery to every push, etc., no
matter how many or in what position. The reason for
selecting this kind is, that with the gutta-percha wires
the joints may be more perfectly covered and made
secure against damp. This is of the utmost importance
in the case of '<i>battery wires</i>,' as the current is always<!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
present and ready to take advantage of any defect
in the insulation to escape to an adjoining wire, or to
'<i>earth</i>,' and so cause a continuous waste of current.
The wires leading from the pushes to the signalling
apparatus or bell we call the 'line' wires. In these,
and the rest of the house wires, the perfect covering of
the joints is important. For <i>line wires</i> we usually prefer
No. 18 or 20 copper, covered with indiarubber, and an
outer coating of cotton, well varnished. In joining the
'<i>battery wires</i>,' the place where the junction is to be
made must be carefully uncovered for the distance of
about an inch; the ends of the wire to be joined, well
cleaned, and tightly twisted together; with the flame of
a spirit lamp or candle the joint must be then heated
sufficiently to melt fine solder in strips when held upon
it, having first put a little powdered resin on the joint
as a flux; the solder should be seen to run well and adhere
firmly to the copper wire. A piece of gutta-percha
should then be taken and placed upon the joint while
warm, and with the aid of the spirit lamp and wet
fingers, moulded round until a firm and perfect covering
has been formed. <i>On no account use spirits</i> in soldering.
With the <i>line wire</i>, it is best, as far as possible, to convey
it all the way from the push to the signal box or bell in
<i>one continuous</i> length. Of course, when two or more
pushes are required to the same wire, a junction is unavoidable.
The same process of joining and covering,
as given for the battery wire, applies to the line wire.
Where many wires are to be brought down to one position,
a large tube may be buried in the wall, or a wood<!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
casing fixed flush with the plaster, with a removable
front. The latter plan is easiest for fixing and for making
alterations and additions. For stapling the wires, in no
case should the wires be left naked. When they pass
along a damp wall, it is best to fix a board and <i>loosely</i>
staple them. <i>In no case allow more than one wire to lie
under the same staple</i>, and do not let the staples touch
one another. In many cases, electric bells have been an
incessant annoyance and complete failure, through driving
the staples <i>tight up to the wires</i>, and several wires to
the same staple,&mdash;this must not be done on any account.
A number of wires may be twisted into a cable,
and run through a short piece of gutta-percha tube, and
fastened with ordinary gas hooks where it is an advantage
to do so. In running the wires, avoid hot water
pipes, and do not take them along the same way as
plumber pipes. Underground wires must be laid between
pieces of wood, or in a gas or drain pipe, and not
exposed in the bare earth without protection, as sharp
pieces of stone are apt to penetrate the covering and
cause a loss; in fact, in this, as in every part of fixing
wires, the best wire and the best protection is by far the
cheapest in the end. The copper wire in this case
should not be less than No. 16 <span class="smcap">B.W.G.</span>, covered with gutta-percha,
to No. 9 or 10 <span class="smcap">B.W.G.</span>, and preferably an outer
covering of tape or braid well tarred. Outside wire,
when run along walls and exposed to the weather,
should be covered with rubber and compound, and varnished
or tarred on an outer covering of tape or braid.
Hooks or staples must be well galvanised to prevent<!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
rusting, and fixed loosely. If the wire is contained
within an iron pipe, a lighter insulation may be used:
<i>but the pipe must be watertight</i>. In a new building,
wires must be contained within zinc or copper bell tubes.
A &#8540; inch tube will hold two wires comfortably. The tubes
should be fixed to terminate in the same positions in the
rooms as ordinary crank bell levers,&mdash;that is, about three
feet from the floor. At the side of the fireplace a block
of wood should be fixed in the wall before any plaster
is put on, and the end of the tube should terminate in
the centre of the same. A large nail or screw may be
put in to mark the place, so that the end of the tube
may be found easily when the plastering is finished. Bend
the tube slightly forward at the end, and insert a short
peg of wood to prevent dirt getting into the tube. Do
the same at the side of, or over the bed in bedroom. If
the tubes are kept clean, the wires may be easily drawn
up or down as the case may require. The best way is
to get a length of ordinary copper bell wire, No. 16,
sufficient to pass through the tube, and having stretched
it, pass it through and out at the other end. Here have
your coils of insulated wire, viz., one battery wire, which
is branched off to every push, and one line wire, which
has to go direct to the indicator or bells, and having
removed a short portion of the insulation from the end
of each, they are tied to the bare copper wire and drawn
through. This is repeated wherever a push is to be fixed
throughout the building. In making connection with
binding screws or metal of any kind, it is of the utmost
importance that everything should be <i>perfectly clean</i><!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>.
<i>Joints</i> in wire, whether tinned or untinned, <i>must be
soldered and covered</i>. We cannot impress this too earnestly
on fixers. Never bury wires in plaster unprotected,
and in houses in course of erection, the <i>tubes</i> only
should be fixed until the plastering is finished, the wires
to be run in at the same time that the other work is
completed."</p>

<p><a name="SEC_71" id="SEC_71"></a>§ 71. The wires having been laid by any of the
methods indicated in the preceding five sections, the
fixer is now in a position to <i>connect up</i>. No two houses
or offices will admit of this being done in <i>exactly</i> the
same way; but in the following sections most of the
possible cases are described
and illustrated,
and the intelligent fixer
will find no difficulty,
when he has once
grasped the principle, in making those trifling modifications
which the particular requirements may render
necessary. The first and simplest form, which engages
our attention, is that of a <i>single bell, battery, and push</i>,
connected by wire only. This is illustrated at <a href="#FIG_75">Fig. 75</a>.
Here we see that the bell is connected by means of one
of the wires to the zinc pole of the battery, the push or
other contact being connected to the carbon pole of the
same battery. A second wire unites the other screw
of the push or contact with the second binding screw
of the bell. There is no complete circuit until the
push is pressed, when the current circulates from
the carbon or positive pole of the battery, through the<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
contact springs of the push, along the wire to the bell,
and then back again through the under wire to the zinc
or negative pole of the battery.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It must be clearly
understood that the exact position of battery, bell, and
push is quite immaterial. What is essential is, that the
relative connections between battery, bell, and push be
maintained unaltered. <a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76</a> shows the next simplest
case, viz., that in which a single bell and push are worked
by a single cell through an "earth" return (see <a href="#SEC_70">§ 70</a>).
Here the current is made to pass from the carbon pole
of the battery to the
push, thence along the
line wire to the bell.
After passing through
the bell, it goes to the
right-hand earth-plate
<span class="smcap">E</span>, passing through the
soil till it reaches the
left-hand earth-plate <span class="smcap">E</span>, thence back to the zinc pole
of the battery. It is of no consequence to the
working of the bell whether the battery be placed
between the push and the left-hand earth-plate, or
between the bell and the right-hand earth-plate; indeed,
some operators prefer to keep the battery as near to the
bell as possible. At <a href="#FIG_77">Fig. 77</a> is shown the mode by
which a single battery and single bell can be made to
ring from two (or more) pushes situated in different
rooms. Here it is evident that, whichever of the two<!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
pushes be pressed, the current finds its way to the bell
by the upper wire, and back home again through the
lower wire; and, even if both pushes are down at once,
the bell rings just the same, for both pushes lead from
the same pole of
the battery (the
carbon) to the same
wire (the line wire).</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIG_78">Fig. 78</a>, we
have a slight modification
of the same arrangement, a front-door <i>pull</i>
contact being inserted in the circuit; and here, in view
of the probably increased resistance of longer distance,
<i>two</i> cells are supposed to be employed instead of <i>one</i>,
and these are coupled up in series (<a href="#SEC_40">§ 40</a>), in order
to overcome this
increased resistance.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 78.</p>
</div>

<p>The next case
which may occur is
where it is desired to
ring two or more
bells from one push.
There are two
manners of doing
this. The first mode
is to make the current divide itself between the two bells,
which are then said to be "<i>in parallel</i>." This mode is well
illustrated both at Figs. <a href="#FIG_79">79</a> and <a href="#FIG_80">80</a>. As in these cases
the current has to divide itself among the bells, larger
cells must be used, to provide for the larger demand; or<!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
several cells may be coupled up in parallel (<a href="#SEC_40">§ 40</a>). At
<a href="#FIG_79">Fig. 79</a> is shown the arrangement for two adjoining
rooms; at <a href="#FIG_80">Fig. 80</a>, that to be adopted when the rooms
are at some distance apart. If, as shown at <a href="#FIG_81">Fig. 81</a>, a
switch similar to that figured in the cut <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a> be
inserted at the
point where the
line wires converge
to meet the push,
it is possible for
the person using
the push to ring both bells at once, or to ring either the
right-hand or the left-hand bell at will, according to
whether he turns the arm of the switch-lever on to
the right-hand or left-hand contact plate.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 81.</p>
</div>

<p>The second mode of ringing two or more bells from
one push is that of
connecting one bell
to the other, the right-hand
binding screw
of the one to the left-hand
binding screw
of the next, and so
on, and then connecting
up the whole
series of bells to
the push and battery, as if they were a single
bell. This mode of disposing the bells is called the
<i>series</i> arrangement. As we have already noticed
at <a href="#SEC_63">§ 63</a>, owing to the difference in the times at which<!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the different contact springs of the various bells
make contact, this mode is not very satisfactory. If the
bells are single stroke
bells, they work very
well in series; but, to
get trembling bells to
work in series, it is
best to adopt the form
of bell recommended
by Mr. F. C. Allsop.
He says: "Perhaps
the best plan is to use
the form of bell shown at <a href="#FIG_82">Fig. 82</a>, which, as will be seen
from the figure, governs its vibrations, not by breaking
the circuit, but by shunting its coils. On the current flowing
round the electro-magnet, the armature is attracted,
and the spring makes contact with the lower screw.<!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
There now exists a path of practically no resistance from
end to end. The current is therefore diverted from
the magnet coils, and passes by the
armature and lower screw to the next
bell, the armature falling back against
the top screw, and repeating the previous
operation so long as the circuit
is closed. Thus, no matter how many
bells there be in the series, the circuit
is never broken. This form of bell,
however, does not ring so energetically
as the ordinary form, with a corresponding
amount of battery power."</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_83">Fig. 83</a> illustrates the mode in which
a bell, at a long distance, must be
coupled up to work with a local battery
and relay. The relay is not shown
separately, but is supposed to be
enclosed in the bell case. Here, on
pressing the push at the external left-hand
corner, the battery current
passes into the relay at the distant
station, and out at the right-hand
earth-plate <span class="smcap">E</span> returning to the left-hand
earth-plate <span class="smcap">E</span>. In doing this, it throws
in circuit (just as long as the push
is held down) the right-hand local
battery, so that the bell rings by the
current sent by the local battery, the more delicate relay
working by the current sent from the distant battery.<!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 85.</p>
</div>

	<p>At <a href="#FIG_84">Fig. 84</a>, we have illustrated the mode of connecting
up a continuous ringing bell, with a wire return. Of
course, if the distance is great, or a
roadway, etc., intervene, an overhead
line and an earth plate may replace
the lines shown therein, or both lines
may be buried. It is possible, by
using a Morse key (<a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>) constructed
so as to make contact in one
direction when <i>not</i> pressed down,
and in the other <i>when</i> pressed down,
to signal from either end of a circuit,
using only one line wire and one
return. The mode of connecting up
for this purpose is shown at <a href="#FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>.
At each end we have a battery and
bell, with a double contact Morse key
as shown, the Morse key at each end
being connected through the intervention of the line wire
through the central stud. The batteries and bells at each<!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
station are connected to earth plates, as shown. Suppose
now we depress the Morse key at the right-hand station.
Since by so doing, we lift the back end of the lever, we
throw our own bell out of circuit, but make contact
between our battery and the line wire. Therefore the
current traverses the line wire, enters in the left-hand
Morse key, and, since this is not depressed, can, and
does, pass into the bell, which therefore rings, then
descends to the left-hand earth-plate, returning along
the ground to the
battery from whence
it started at the
right-hand <span class="smcap">E</span>. If, on
the contrary, the <i>left</i>-hand
Morse key be
depressed, while the
right-hand key is not
being manipulated,
the current traverses
in the opposite
direction, and the right-hand bell rings. Instead of
Morse keys, <i>double contact</i> pushes (that is, pushes
making contact in one direction when <i>not</i> pressed, and
in the opposite <i>when</i> pressed) may advantageously
be employed. This latter arrangement is shown at
<a href="#FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 86.</p>
</div>

<p>It is also possible, as shown at <a href="#FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>, to send signals
from two stations, using but one battery (which, if the
distance is great, should be of a proportionate number
of cells), two bells, and two ordinary pushes. Three<!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
wires, besides the earth-plate or return wire, are required
in this case. The whole of the wires,
except the <i>return</i>, must be carefully
insulated. Suppose in this case we
press the right-hand button. The
current flows from the battery along
the lower wire through this right-hand
push and returns to the distant bell
along the top wire, down the left-hand
dotted wire back to the battery, since
it cannot enter by the left-hand press,
which, not being pushed, makes no
contact. The left-hand bell therefore
rings. If, on the other hand, the left-hand
push be pressed, the current
from the carbon of the battery passes
through the left-hand push, traverses
the central line wire, passes into the
bell, rings it, and descends to the right-hand
earth plate <span class="smcap">E</span>, traverses the earth
circuit till it reaches the left-hand
earth plate <span class="smcap">E</span>, whence it returns to
the zinc pole of the battery by the
lower dotted line.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_88">Fig. 88</a> shows how the same result

be attained, using only two wires,
with earth return, and two Morse
keys. The direction of the current is shown by
the arrows. Both wires must be insulated and<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
either carried overhead or underground, buried in
tubes. <a href="#FIG_89">Fig. 89</a> shows the proper
mode of connecting the entire system
of bells, pushes, etc., running through
a building. The dotted lines are the
wires starting from the two poles
of the battery (which should consist
of more cells in proportion as there
is more work to do), the plain lines
being the wires between the pushes
and the bell and signalling box. In
this illustration a door-pull is shown
to the extreme left. Pendulum
indicators are usually connected up
as shown in this figure, except that
the bell is generally enclosed in the
indicator case. The wire, therefore,
has to be carried from the left-hand
screw of the indicator case direct to
the upper dotted line, which is the
wire returning to the zinc pole of
the battery. N.B.&mdash;When the wires
from the press-buttons are connected
with the binding-screw, of the top of

insulating material of the wires, at
the point where connection is to be
made, must be removed, and the
wires <i>carefully cleaned</i> and <i>tightly clamped down</i>.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_73" id="SEC_73"></a>§ 73. There are still two cases of electric bell and
signal fitting, to which attention must be directed.
The first is in the case of <i>ships</i>. Here all the connections
can be made exactly as in a house, the only exception
to be made being that the indicators must not be of
the <i>pendulum</i>, or other easily displaced type; but either
of the form shown at <a href="#FIG_67">Fig. 67</a> or <a href="#FIG_68">68</a>, in which the electro-magnet
has to lift a latch to release the fall or drop,
against a pretty stiff spring. Besides being thus firmly
locking, so as not to be affected by the ship's motion, all
the wood work should be soaked in melted paraffin wax,
the iron work japanned, and the brass work well
lacquered, to protect all parts from damp. The second
case requiring notice is that of <i>lifts</i>. Every well-appointed
lift should be fitted with electric bells and<!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
indicators. In the cab of the lift itself should be placed
an electric bell, with as many double contact pushes and
indicators as there are floors to be communicated with.
At the top and at the bottom of the left shaft, as near
to the landing side as possible, must be set two stout
wooden blocks (oak, elm, or other non-perishable wood).
From top to bottom of the shaft must then be stretched, in
the same manner as a pianoforte is strung, on stout metal
pins, with threading holes and square heads, as many
No. 12 or 14 bare copper wires as there are floors or
landings, and two more for the battery and return wire
respectively. Care must be taken that these wires are strung
perfectly parallel, and that they are stretched quite taut,
but not strained, otherwise they will surely break. To the
top of the cab, and in connection in the usual manner
by wires with the bell and indicator (which, as in the case
of ships, must be of the locking type, lest the jolts of the
cab disturb their action) must be attached a number of
spoonbill springs, which press against the naked wires
running down the shaft. The shape of these springs
(which should be of brass) at the part where they press
against the bare wires, is similar to that of the spoon
break of a bicycle. Some operators use rollers at the
end of the spring instead of spoonbills, but these latter
<i>rub</i> the wires and keep up good contact, while the rollers
slip over the wires and do not keep them clean. By
means of these springs, the current from the batteries,
which are best placed either at the top of the lift itself,
or in one of the adjacent rooms (never at the bottom of
the shaft, owing to the damp which always reigns there),<!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
can be taken off and directed where it is desired, precisely
as if the batteries were in the cab itself. It is
usual (though not obligatory) to use the two wires <i>furthest</i>
from the landing as the go and return battery wires,
and from these, through the other wires, all desired
communication with the landings can be effected. To
obtain this end, it will be necessary to furnish every landing
with a double contact push and bell, and each bell
and push must be connected up to the shaft wires in the
following mode:&mdash;</p>

<p>A wire must be led from the <i>lower</i> contact spring of
the double contact push, to the <i>main battery carbon wire</i>
in the shaft. A second wire is led from the <i>upper contact
stop</i> of the double contact push to the bell, and thence
to the <i>main battery zinc wire</i> on the shaft. Lastly, a
third wire is taken from the <i>upper contact spring</i> of the
push and connected to that particular wire in the shaft
which by means of the spoonbill springs connects the
particular push and indicator in the cab, destined to
correspond with it. It will be seen that with the exception
of using the rubbing spoonbill springs and return
wires in the shaft, this arrangement is similar to that
illustrated at <a href="#FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 91.</p>
</div>

<p>A glance at <a href="#FIG_91">Fig. 91</a> will render the whole system of
wiring and connecting up with lifts and landing, perfectly
clear. In connecting the branch lines to the main
bare copper wires in the shaft, in order that the spoonbill
springs should not interfere with them, they (the
ends of the branch wires) must be bent at right angles,
like a letter L, and the upright portion soldered neatly<!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to the <i>back</i> of the shaft wire. Any solder which may
flow over to the <i>front</i> of the wire must be carefully
scraped off to prevent any bumps affecting the smooth
working of the contact springs. It will be evident on
examination of <a href="#FIG_91">Fig. 91</a>, that if any of the pushes on the
landings be pressed, the circuit is completed between
the battery at the top, through the two battery wires<!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to the bell and one of the indicators to the cab, and, on
the other hand, that if a push be pressed in the cab, a
corresponding bell on the landing will be rung, precisely
as in <a href="#FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>.</p>

<p>Some fitters employ a many-stranded cable to convey
the current to and from the battery to the cab and landing,
instead of the system of stretched wires herein recommended;
but this practice cannot be advocated, as
the continual bending and
unbending of this cable,
repeated so frequently every
day, soon breaks the leading
wires contained in the cable.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_74" id="SEC_74"></a>§ 74. In many cases where
a "call" bell alone is required,
the battery may be entirely
dispensed with, and a small
dynamo (<a href="#SEC_15">§ 15</a>) employed instead.
The entire apparatus
is then known as the
"magneto-bell," and consists
essentially of two parts, viz., the generator, <a href="#FIG_92">Fig. 92</a>,
and the bell, <a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>. The <i>generator</i> or <i>inductor</i> consists
of an armature, which by means of a projecting
handle and train of wheels can be revolved rapidly
between the poles of a powerful magnet; the whole being
enclosed in a box. The current produced by the revolution
of the armature is led to the two binding screws
at the top of the box. By means of two wires, or one
wire and an earth circuit, the current is led to the<!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
receiver or bell case, <a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>. Here, there are usually
two bells, placed very near one another, and the armature
attached to the bell clapper is so arranged between the
poles of the double-bell magnets, that it strikes alternately
the one and the other, so that a clear ringing is
kept up as long as the handle is being turned at the
generator.</p>

<p>If a <i>combined</i> generator and bell be fitted at each
end of a line, it becomes possible to communicate both
ways; one terminal of each
instrument must be connected
to the line, and the other terminal
on each to earth. A combined
generator and bell is shown at
<a href="#FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>. These instruments are
always ready for use, require no
battery or press-buttons. The
generator, <a href="#FIG_92">Fig. 92</a>, will ring seven
bells simultaneously, if required,
so powerful is the current set up; and by using a switch
any number of bells, placed in different positions, can
be rung, by carrying a separate wire from the switch
to the bell.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_75" id="SEC_75"></a>§ 75. Our work would not be complete unless we
pointed out the means necessary to detect faults in our
work. In order to localise faults, two things are requisite:
first, a means of knowing whether the battery itself is
working properly, that is to say, giving the due <i>amount</i>
of current of the right <i>pressure</i>, or E.M.F.; secondly, a
means of detecting whether there is leakage, or loss of<!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
current, or break of circuit in our lines. Fortunately,
the means of ascertaining these data can be all combined
in one instrument, known as a linesman's galvanometer
or detector, of which we give an
illustration at <a href="#FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>. It will be remembered
(<a href="#SEC_10">§ 10</a>) that if a current be
passed over or under a poised magnetic
needle, parallel to it, the needle is
immediately deflected out of the
parallel line, and swings round to the
right or left of the current, according to
the <i>direction</i> of the current; likewise
that the needle is deflected farther from the original
position as the current becomes stronger. The deflections,
however, are not proportionate
to the strength of the
current, being fairly so up to
about 25 to 30 degrees of arc
out of the original position, but
being very much less than
proportionate to the current
strength as the needle gets
farther from the line of current;
so that a current of infinite
strength would be required to
send the needle up to 90°. On
this principle the detector is
constructed. It consists of a lozenge-shaped magnetic
needle, suspended vertically on a light spindle, carrying at
one end a pointer, which indicates on a card, or metal dial,<!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the deflection of the needle. Behind the dial is arranged
a flat upright coil of wire (or two coils in many cases)
parallel to the needle, along which the current to be
tested can be sent. The needle lies between the front
and back of the flat coil. The whole is enclosed in a
neat wooden box, with glazed front to show the dial,
and binding screws to connect up to the enclosed coil or
coils. If the coil surrounding the needle be of a few
turns of coarse wire, since it opposes little resistance to
the passage of the current, it will serve to detect the
presence of large <i>quantities</i> of electricity (many ampères)
at a low pressure; this is called a <i>quantity</i> coil. If, on
the other hand, the coil be one of fine wire, in many
convolutions, as it requires more <i>pressure</i>, or E.M.F.,
or "intensity" to force the current through the fine
high-resistance wire, the instrument becomes one
fitted to measure the voltage or <i>pressure</i> of the
current, and the coil is known as the "intensity."
If both coils are inserted in the case, so that either can
be used at will, the instrument is capable of measuring
either the quantity of electricity passing, or the pressure
at which it is sent, and is then known as a quantity and
intensity detector. No two galvanometers give exactly
the same deflection for the same amount of current, or
the same pressure; the fitter will therefore do well to
run out a little table (which he will soon learn by heart)
of the deflection <i>his</i> instrument gives with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6 Leclanché's <i>coupled in parallel</i>, when connected
with the quantity coil. He will find the smaller sizes
give less current than the larger ones. In testing the<!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
deflections given by the intensity coil, he must remember
to couple his cells <i>in series</i>, as he will get no increase
in <i>tension</i> or <i>pressure</i> by coupling up in parallel. In
either case the cells should be new, and freshly set up,
say, within 24 hours. As some of my readers may like
to try their skill at constructing such a detector, I transcribe
the directions given in "Amateur work" by Mr.
Edwinson:&mdash;</p>


<p><a name="SEC_76" id="SEC_76"></a>§ 76. "Such an instrument, suitable for detecting the
currents in an electric bell circuit, may be made up at the
cost of a few shillings for material, and by the exercise of
a little constructive ability. We shall need, first of all, a
magnetised needle; this can be made out of a piece of
watch spring. Procure a piece of watch spring two
inches long, soften it by heating it to redness, and
allowing it to cool gradually in a bed of hot ashes;
then file it up to the form of a long lozenge, drill a
small hole in the centre to receive the spindle or pivot,
see that the needle is quite straight, then harden it by
heating it again to a bright red and plunging it at once into
cold water. It now has to be magnetised. To do this,
rub it on a permanent horse-shoe, or other magnet,
until it will attract an ordinary sewing needle strongly,
or wrap it up in several turns of insulated line wire, and
send many jerky charges of electricity from a strong
battery through the wire. When it has been well magnetised,
mount it on a spindle of fine hard wire, and
secure it by a drop of solder. We will next turn our
attention to the case, bobbin, or chamber in which the
needle has to work. This may be made out of card<!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>board
entirely, or the end pieces may be made of ivory
or ebonite, or it may be made out of thin sheet brass;
for our purpose we will choose cardboard. Procure a
piece of stout cardboard 4&frac34; inches long by 2 inches
wide, double it to the form of a Tãndstickor match-box,
and pierce it in exactly opposite sides, and in the
centre of those sides with holes for the needle spindle.
Now cut another piece of stout, stiff cardboard 2&frac34; inches
long by &frac34; inch wide, and cut a slit with a sharp knife
to exactly fit the ends of the case or body already prepared.
The spindle holes must now be bushed with
short lengths of hard brass or glass bugles, or tubing,
made to allow the spindle free movement, and these
secured in position by a little melted shellac, sealing-wax,
or glue. The needle must now be placed in the
case, the long end of the spindle first, then the short
end in its bearing; then, whilst the case with the needle
enclosed is held between the finger and thumb of the
left hand, we secure the joint with a little glue or with
melted sealing-wax. The end-pieces are now to be put
on, glued, or sealed in position, and set aside to get firm,
whilst we turn our attention to other parts. The case,
5 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches in depth, may be
improvised out of an old cigar-box, but is best made of
thin mahogany or teak, nicely polished on the outside,
and fitted with a cover sliding in a groove, or hinged to
form the back of the instrument. The binding screws
should be of the pattern known as the telegraph pattern,
fitted with nuts, shown at <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>. A small brass
handle to be fitted to the top of the instrument,<!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
will also be handy. A circular piece of smooth
cardboard 3&frac14; inches in diameter, with a graduated
arc, marked as shown in <a href="#FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>, will serve the purpose
of a dial, and a piece of thin brass, bent to the form of
&#9487;&#9473;&#9491;, will be required as a needle guard. The face
of the dial may be a circular piece of glass, held in a
brass ogee, or a hole the size of the dial may be cut in
a piece of thin wood; this, glazed on the inside with a
square of glass, may be made to form the front of the
instrument over the dial. An indicating needle will also
be required for an outside needle; this is usually
made of watch spring, and nicely blued; but it may
be made of brass or any other metal, one made of
aluminium being probably the best on account of its
lightness. It must be pierced with a hole exactly in
the centre, so as to balance it as the beam of scales
should be balanced, and should one end be heavier than
the other it must be filed until they are equal.</p>

<p>We will now turn our attention to the coil.</p>

<p>Procure sixpennyworth of No. 36 silk-covered copper
wire and wind three layers of it very evenly on the coil
case or bobbin, being careful in passing the needle
spindle not to pinch it or throw it out of truth. When
this has been wound on, it will be found that one end of
the wire points to the left and the other end to the right.
These are destined to be connected to the under side of
the binding screws shown on the top of <a href="#FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>. We
therefore secure them to their respective sides with a
touch of sealing wax, and leave enough wire free at the
ends to reach the binding screws&mdash;say, about 6 inches.<!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
It is handy to have an additional coil for testing strong
currents, and as this may be combined in one instrument
at a trifle additional cost, we will get some line wire
(No. 22) and wind six or eight turns of it around the
coil outside the other wire; one end of this wire will be
attached to an additional binding screw placed between
the others, and the other end to left binding screw
shown. The coil thus prepared may now be mounted
in position. Pierce the board dial and the wood at its
back with a hole large enough for the needle spindle to
pass through from the back to the centre of the dial.
See that the thick end of the inside needle hangs downwards,
then place the coil in the position it is intended
to occupy, and note how far the needle spindle protrudes
on the face of the dial. If this is too long, nip
off the end and file it up taper and smooth until it will
work freely in a hole in the needle guard, with all parts
in their proper places. This being satisfactory, secure
the coil in its place by sealing wax, or, better still, by
two thin straps of brass, held by screws at each end,
placed across the coil. Now clean the free ends of the
coil wires, insert them under the nuts of the binding
screws, fix the indicating needle on the end of the spindle
outside, and see that it hangs in a vertical position with
the inside needle when the instrument is standing on a
level surface. Secure it in this position, screw on the
needle guard, fasten on the glass face, and the instrument
will be complete.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_77" id="SEC_77"></a>§ 77. Provided thus with an efficient detector, the
fitter may proceed to test his work. In cases of <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<i>new installations</i>, take the wire off the carbon binding screw
of the battery and attach it to one screw of the galvanometer
(on the intensity coil side), next attach a piece
of wire from the other binding screw of the galvanometer
(the central one) so as to place the galvanometer
in circuit. <i>There should be no movement of the needle</i>,
and in proportion to the deflection of the needle, so will
the loss or waste be. If loss is going on, every means
must be used to remedy it. It is of the utmost importance
to the effective working of the battery and bells
that not the <i>slightest leakage</i> or <i>local action</i> should be
allowed to remain. However slight such loss may be,
it will eventually ruin the battery. Let damp places be
sought out, and the wires removed from near them. Bad
or injured coverings must also be looked for, such as
may have been caused by roughly drawing the wires
across angular walls, treading on them, or driving staples
too tightly over them. Two or more staples may be
touching, or two or more wires carelessly allowed to lie
under one staple. The wire may have been bared in
some places in passing over the sharp edges of the zinc
tube. The backs of the pushes should be examined to see
if too much wire has been bared, and is touching another
wire at the back of the push-case itself. Or the same
thing may be taking place at the junction with the
relays or at the indicator cases. Should the defect not
be at any of these places, the indicator should next be
examined, and wire by wire detached (not cut) until the
particular wire in which the loss is going on has been
found. This wire should then be traced until the defect<!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
has been discovered. In testing underground wires for
a loss or break, it will be necessary first to uncouple the
<i>distant</i> end, then to disconnect the other end from the
instruments, and attach the wire going underground to
the screw of the galvanometer. A piece of wire must
then be taken from the other screw of the detector to
the carbon end of the battery, and a second wire from
the zinc end of the battery to the earth plate or other
connection. Proceeding to that part of the wire where
the injury is suspected, the wire is taken up, and a temporary
earth connection having been made (water main,
gas pipe, etc.), and by means of a sharp knife connected
with this latter, the covering of the suspected wire
penetrated through to the wire, so as to make a good
connection between this suspected wire and the temporary
earth plates. If, when this is done, the needle
is deflected fully, the injury is farther away from the
testing end, and other trials must be made farther on,
until the spot is discovered. Wherever the covering of
the wire has been pierced for testing, it must be carefully
recovered, finished off with Prout's elastic glue, or
gutta-percha, and made quite sound. The connections
with the earth plates very frequently give trouble, the
wires corrode or become detached from the iron pipes
etc., and then the circuit is broken.</p>


<p><a name="SEC_78" id="SEC_78"></a>§ 78. When the fitter is called to localise defects
which may have occurred in an installation which has
been put up some time, before proceeding to work
let him ask questions as to what kind of defect there
is, and when and where it evinces itself. If all the<!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
bells have broken down, and will not ring, either the
battery or the main go and return wires are at fault.
Let him proceed to the battery, examine the binding
screws and connected wires for corrosion. If they are
all right, let the batteries themselves be tested to see
if they are giving the right amount of current. This
should be done with the quantity coil of the detector.
Should the battery be faulty, it will be well to renew the
zincs and recharge the battery, if the porous cell be still
in good condition; if not, new cells should be substituted
for the old ones. Should the battery be all right, and
still none of the bells ring, a break or bad contact,
or short circuit in the main wires near the battery
may be the cause of the mischief. If some bell rings
continuously, there must be a short circuit in the push
or pushes somewhere; the upper spring of one of the
pushes may have got bent, or have otherwise caught
in the lower spring. <i>Pulls</i> are very subject to this
defect. By violent manipulations on the part of
mischievous butcher or baker boys, the return spring
may be broken, or so far weakened as not to return
the pull into the "off" position. If, the batteries being
in good order, any bell rings feebly, there is either
leakage along its line, or else bad contact in the push
or in the connections of the wires to and from the
push. There should be platinum contacts at the ends
of the push springs; if there are not, the springs may
have worked dirty at the points of contact, hence the
poor current and poor ringing. It is seldom that the
bells themselves, unless, indeed, of the lowest quality,<!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
give any serious trouble. Still the set screw may have
shaken loose (which must then be adjusted and tightened
up), or the platinum speck has got solder on its
face and therefore got oxidised. This may be scraped
carefully with a penknife until bright. Or, purposely
or inadvertently, no platinum is on the speck at all,
only the solder. A piece of platinum foil should be
soldered on the spot, if this is so. Or again (and this
only in very bad bells), the electro-magnets being of
hard iron, may have retained a certain amount
of <i>permanent magnetism</i>, and pull the armature into
permanent contact with itself. This can be remedied
by sticking a thin piece of paper (stamp paper will do)
over the poles of the magnet, between them and the
armature. In no case should the fitter <i>cut</i> or <i>draw up</i>
out of tubes, etc., any wire or wires, without having first
ascertained that the fault is in that wire; for, however
carefully joints are made, it is rare that the jointed
places are so thoroughly insulated as they were before
the cutting and subsequent joining were undertaken.
To avoid as much as possible cutting uselessly, let
every binding screw be examined and tightened up,
and every length of wire, which it is possible to get at,
be tested for continuity before any "slashing" at the
wires, or furious onslaughts on the indicator be consummated.</p>

<p>Since the compilation of the foregoing pages, a <i>dry
battery</i>, known by the above name, has found great
favour with electric-bell fitters. Its peculiarity consists
in the zinc element forming the outside cell. In this is
placed the carbon, which is separated from the zinc by
a thick paste or jelly made of gypsum and oxide of
zinc. The cell can be placed in any position, works as
well on its side as upright, is not subject to creeping,
has an E.M.F. of about 1·5 volt, with an internal resistance
of only 0·25 ohm in the round form, and 0·6 in
the flat form. The Gassner dry battery polarizes much
less quickly than the ordinary Leclanché. The only
defects at present noticeable, are the flimsy connections,
and the fact that the outer cases being <i>metal</i> must be
carefully guarded from touching one another. This
can be effected by enclosing in a partitioned <i>wooden box</i>.<!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
